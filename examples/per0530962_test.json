            "abstract":"Botulism is a rare, life-threatening paralytic disease caused by Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT). Available treatments, including an equine antitoxin and human immune globulin, are given postexposure and challenging to produce and administer. NTM-1632 is an equimolar mixture of 3 human IgG monoclonal antibodies, B1, B2, and B3, targeting BoNT serotype B (BoNT/B). This first-in-human study assessed the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity of NTM-1632. This double-blind, single-center, placebo-controlled dose escalation study randomized 3 cohorts of healthy volunteers to receive a single intravenous dose of NTM-1632 (0.033, 0.165, or 0.330 mg/kg) or saline placebo. Safety monitoring included physical examinations, clinical laboratory studies, and vital signs. Blood sampling was performed at prespecified time points for PK and immunogenicity analyses. Twenty-four subjects received study product (18 NTM-1632; 6 placebo), and no deaths or serious adverse events were reported. Adverse events in the NTM-1632 groups were generally mild and similar in frequency and severity to the placebo group, and no safety signal was identified. NTM-1632 has a favorable PK profile with a half-life of >20 days for the 0.330-mg/kg dose and an approximately linear relationship with respect to maximum concentration and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0→t). NTM-1632 demonstrated low immunogenicity with only a few treatment-emergent antidrug antibody responses in the low and middle dosing groups and none at the highest dose. NTM-1632 is well tolerated at the administered doses. The favorable safety, PK, and immunogenicity profile of NTM-1632 supports further clinical development as a treatment for BoNT/B intoxication and postexposure prophylaxis. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under identifier NCT02779140.).",

            "abstract":"OBJECTIVE:  In the antenatal late preterm steroids (ALPS) trial betamethasone significantly decreased short-term neonatal respiratory morbidity but increased the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia, diagnosed only categorically (<40 mg/dL). We sought to better characterize the nature, duration, and treatment for hypoglycemia. STUDY DESIGN:  Secondary analysis of infants from ALPS, a multicenter trial randomizing women at risk for late preterm delivery to betamethasone or placebo. This study was a reabstraction of all available charts from the parent trial, all of which were requested. Unreviewed charts included those lost to follow-up or from sites not participating in the reabstraction. Duration of hypoglycemia (<40 mg/dL), lowest value and treatment, if any, were assessed by group. Measures of association and regression models were used where appropriate. RESULTS:  Of 2,831 randomized, 2,609 (92.2%) were included. There were 387 (29.3%) and 223 (17.3%) with hypoglycemia in the betamethasone and placebo groups, respectively (relative risk [RR]: 1.69, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.46-1.96). Hypoglycemia generally occurred in the first 24 hours in both groups: 374/385 (97.1%) in the betamethasone group and 214/222 (96.4%) in the placebo group (p = 0.63). Of 387 neonates with hypoglycemia in the betamethasone group, 132 (34.1%) received treatment, while 73/223 (32.7%) received treatment in placebo group (p = 0.73). The lowest recorded blood sugar was similar between groups. Most hypoglycemia resolved by 24 hours in both (93.0 vs. 89.3% in the betamethasone and placebo groups, respectively, p = 0.18). Among infants with hypoglycemia in the first 24 hours, the time to resolution was shorter in the betamethasone group (2.80 [interquartile range: 2.03-7.03) vs. 3.74 (interquartile range: 2.15-15.08) hours; p = 0.002]. Persistence for >72 hours was rare and similar in both groups, nine (2.4%, betamethasone) and four (1.9%, placebo, p = 0.18). CONCLUSION:  In this cohort, hypoglycemia was transient and most received no treatment, with a quicker resolution in the betamethasone group. Prolonged hypoglycemia was uncommon irrespective of steroid exposure. KEY POINTS: · Hypoglycemia was transient and approximately two-thirds received no treatment.. · Neonates in the ALPS trial who received betamethasone had a shorter time to resolution than those with hypoglycemia in the placebo group.. · Prolonged hypoglycemia occurred in approximately 2 out of 100 late preterm newborns, irrespective of antenatal steroid exposure..",

            "abstract":"As of December 1, 2020, nearly 64 million people have been infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 worldwide with nearly 1.5 million global deaths. The impact of this virus has continued to overwhelm hospital infrastructure and demanded remodeling of healthcare systems. With rising concerns for a third, and possibly the largest, wave of individuals infected with the virus, national leaders are continuing to seek avenues by which we can further limit disease transmission and prevent infection with the use of vaccination. To our knowledge, no clinical trial evaluating vaccines to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 has included pregnant women. In December 2020, it was anticipated that the Food and Drug Administration will approve at least 1 or 2 mRNA-based coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine under the Emergency Use Authorization based on phase 3 clinical trial efficacy data. Both Pfizer and Moderna have manufactured mRNA-based vaccines with 95% and 94.1% efficacy against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. AstraZeneca has manufactured a vaccine using a viral vector demonstrating early efficacy as well, and this next-generation platform has previously been utilized with the Ebola vaccine and safely administered during pregnancy with an acceptable safety profile. Approval of these vaccines will have a tremendous impact on the ongoing pandemic, yet there remains a lack of data for use of coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine in pregnant women. In this article, we seek to discuss the available data regarding treatment and prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy and address the growing questions regarding how best to approach vaccine access and administration in the pregnant population.",

            "abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To compare risks of maternal and perinatal outcomes by completed week of gestation from 39 weeks in low-risk nulliparous patients undergoing expectant management. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of a multicenter randomized trial of elective induction of labor at 39 weeks of gestation compared with expectant management in low-risk nulliparous patients. Participants with nonanomalous neonates, who were randomized to and underwent expectant management and attained 39 0/7 weeks of gestation, were included. Delivery gestation was categorized by completed week: 39 0/7-39 6/7 (39 weeks), 40 0/7-40 6/7 (40 weeks), and 41 0/7-42 2/7 (41-42 weeks) (none delivered after 42 2/7). The coprimary outcomes were cesarean delivery and a perinatal composite (death, respiratory support, 5-minute Apgar score 3 or less, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, seizure, sepsis, meconium aspiration syndrome, birth trauma, intracranial or subgaleal hemorrhage, or hypotension requiring vasopressor support). Other outcomes included a maternal composite (blood transfusion, surgical intervention for postpartum hemorrhage, or intensive care unit admission), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, peripartum infection, and neonatal intermediate or intensive care unit admission. For multivariable analysis, P<.0125 was considered to indicate statistical significance for the coprimary outcomes. RESULTS: Of 2,502 participants who underwent expectant management, 964 (38.5%) delivered at 39 weeks of gestation, 1,111 (44.4%) at 40 weeks, and 427 (17.1%) at 41-42 weeks. The prevalence of medically indicated delivery was 37.9% overall and increased from 23.8% at 39 weeks of gestation to 80.3% at 41-42 weeks. The frequency of cesarean delivery (17.3%, 22.0%, 37.5%; P<.001) and the perinatal composite (5.1%, 5.9%, 8.2%; P=.03) increased with 39, 40, and 41-42 weeks of gestation, respectively, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy decreased (16.4%, 12.1%, 10.8%, P=.001). The adjusted relative risk, 95% CI (39 weeks as referent) was significant for cesarean delivery at 41-42 weeks of gestation (1.93, 1.61-2.32) and for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy at 40 weeks (0.71, 0.58-0.88) and 41-42 weeks (0.61, 0.45-0.82). None of the other outcomes were significant. CONCLUSION: In expectantly managed low-risk nulliparous participants, the frequency of medically indicated induction of labor, and the risks of cesarean delivery but not the perinatal composite outcome, increased significantly from 39 to 42 weeks of gestation.",

            "abstract":"BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of an investigational trivalent group B streptococcus (GBS) vaccine in US pregnant women, transplacental serotype-specific antibody transfer and persistence in infants, and serotype-specific antibodies in breast milk. METHODS: This randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled trial administered one dose of trivalent GBS vaccine (n = 49) or placebo (n = 26) to healthy pregnant 18-40-year-old women at 240/7-346/7 weeks' gestation. Women were enrolled from March 2014 to August 2015. Safety follow-up continued through postpartum day 180. Primary immunogenicity objectives were to evaluate serotype Ia/Ib/III-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels in sera from women on day 1 (pre-vaccination), day 31, delivery and postpartum days 42 and 90, and from infants at birth (cord blood), days 42 and 90. Antibody transfer ratios (cord blood/maternal sera at delivery) and serotype-specific secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) and IgG in breast milk after delivery and on postpartum days 42 and 90 were evaluated. The planned sample size was not based on statistical assumptions for this descriptive study. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Serious adverse events were reported for 16% of GBS-vaccinated women and 15% of their infants, and 15% of placebo recipients and 12% of their infants; none were fatal or deemed vaccine-related. Serotype-specific IgG geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) were 13-23-fold higher in vaccine vs placebo recipients on day 31 and persisted until postpartum day 90. Median antibody concentrations were substantially higher in women with detectable pre-vaccination antibody concentrations. Antibody transfer ratios in the vaccine group were 0.62-0.82. Infant IgG GMCs and breast milk sIgA GMCs were higher in the vaccine vs the placebo group at all timepoints. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal immunization with the trivalent GBS vaccine in US women had a favorable safety profile, elicited antibodies that were transplacentally transferred and persisted in infants for a minimum of 3 months.

            "abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate characteristics associated with adverse outcomes in low-risk nulliparous women randomized to elective labor induction at 39 weeks of gestation or expectant management. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of women randomized during the 38th week to induction at 39 weeks of gestation or expectant management. Deliveries before 39 weeks of gestation and those not adherent to study protocol or with fetal anomalies were excluded. A composite of adverse outcomes (perinatal death or severe neonatal complications), third- or fourth-degree lacerations, and postpartum hemorrhage were evaluated. Log binomial regression models estimated relative risks and 95% CIs for associations of outcomes with patient characteristics including randomly assigned treatment group. Interactions between patient characteristics and treatment group were tested. RESULTS: Of 6,096 women with outcome data, 5,007 (82.1%) met criteria for inclusion in this analysis. Frequency of the perinatal composite was 252 (5.0%), 166 (3.3%) for third- or fourth-degree perineal laceration, and 237 (4.7%) for postpartum hemorrhage. In multivariable analysis, intended labor induction at 39 weeks of gestation was associated with a reduced perinatal composite outcome (4.1% vs 6.0%; adjusted relative risk [aRR] 0.71; 95% CI 0.55-0.90), whereas increasing body mass index (BMI) was associated with an increased perinatal composite outcome (aRR 1.04/unit increase; 95% CI 1.02-1.05). Decreased risk of third- or fourth-degree perineal laceration was observed with increasing BMI (aRR 0.96/unit increase; 95% CI 0.93-0.98) and in Black women compared with White women (1.2% vs 3.9%; aRR 0.34; 95% CI 0.19-0.60). Increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage was observed in Hispanic women compared with White women (6.3% vs 4.0%; aRR 1.64; 95% CI 1.18-2.29). Patient characteristics associated with adverse outcomes were similar between treatment groups (P for interaction >.05). CONCLUSION: Compared with expectant management, intended induction at 39 weeks of gestation was associated with reduced risk of adverse perinatal outcome. Patient characteristics associated with adverse outcomes were few and similar between groups. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01990612.",

            "abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To develop models to predict vaginal delivery in low-risk, nulliparous women contemplating elective induction of labor or expectant management at 39 weeks of gestation. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial of planned elective induction of labor at 39 weeks of gestation compared with expectant management for low-risk nulliparous women. Two groups were included for this analysis: 1) women who were randomized to the induction of labor group and underwent elective induction at 39 0/7-39 4/7 weeks of gestation and 2) women who were randomized to the expectant management group who experienced spontaneous labor or medically indicated delivery (including postterm). Multivariable logistic regression models were developed for each group using patient characteristics that would be available at the time of counseling. Model selection was based on k-fold cross-validation using backward elimination and variables that remained significant at P<.05 were retained. To compare estimated with observed rates, the elective induction of labor model was then applied to each woman in both groups to estimate individualized predicted probabilities of vaginal delivery with elective induction of labor. RESULTS: Of 6,106 women enrolled in the trial, 4,661 met criteria for this analysis. Vaginal delivery occurred in 80.6% of the 2,153 women in the elective induction of labor group and 77.2% of the 2,508 women in the expectant management group (P=.005). The final elective induction of labor model included age, height, weight, and modified Bishop score (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] 0.72, 95% CI 0.70-0.75). The same variables were included in the final expectant management model (AUROC 0.70, 95% CI 0.67-0.72). Across the range of predicted probability deciles derived from the elective induction of labor model, almost all women who underwent elective induction of labor at 39 weeks of gestation had a higher observed chance of vaginal delivery than expectant management. CONCLUSION: Irrespective of the individual predicted chance of vaginal delivery from elective induction of labor at 39 weeks of gestation, vaginal delivery is generally more frequent if elective induction of labor is undertaken rather than expectant management. These data can be used to counsel nulliparous women regarding their \"customized\" chances of vaginal delivery as they choose between elective induction of labor or expectant management at 39 weeks of gestation.

            "abstract":"BACKGROUND: Pregnant women with a history of preterm birth are at risk for recurrence, often requiring frequent prenatal visits for close monitoring and/or preventive therapies. Employment demands can limit uptake and adherence to recommended monitoring and preterm birth prevention therapies. METHOD: We conducted a qualitative descriptive study using in-depth interviews (IDIs) of pregnant women with a history of preterm birth. IDIs were conducted by trained qualitative interviewers following a semi-structured interview guide focused on uncovering barriers and facilitators to initiation of prenatal care, including relevant employment experiences, and soliciting potential interventions to improve prompt prenatal care initiation. The IDIs were analyzed via applied thematic analysis. RESULTS: We described the interview findings that address women's employment experiences. The current analysis includes 27 women who are majority self-described as non-Hispanic Black (74%) and publically insured (70%). Participants were employed in a range of professions; food services, childcare and retail were the most common occupations. Participants described multiple ways that being pregnant impacted their earning potential, ranging from voluntary work-hour reduction, involuntary duty hour reductions by employers, truncated promotions, and termination of employment. Participants also shared varying experiences with workplace accommodations to their work environment and job duties based on their pregnancy. Some of these accommodations were initiated by a collaborative employee/employer discussion, others were initiated by the employer's perception of safe working conditions in pregnancy, and some accommodations were based on medical recommendations. Participants described supportive and unsupportive employer reactions to requests for accommodations. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide novel insights into women's experiences balancing a pregnancy at increased risk for preterm birth with employment obligations. While many women reported positive experiences, the most striking insights came from women who described negative situations that ranged from challenging to potentially unlawful. Many of the findings suggest profound misunderstandings likely exist at the patient, employer and clinical provider level about the laws surrounding employment in pregnancy, safe employment responsibilities during pregnancy, and the range of creative accommodations that often allow for continued workplace productivity even during high risk pregnancy.",

            "abstract":"Summary of study: A multi-country randomized, placebo-controlled trial of the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F-protein nanoparticle vaccine was undertaken in 4,636 pregnant women and their infants. RSV F-protein vaccine was safe and immunogenic in the pregnant women inducing anti-F IgG, palivizumab-competing antibodies and RSV neutralizing antibodies that were transferred to the fetus. Although the primary endpoint of prevention of RSV-specific medically-significant lower respiratory tract infection (MS-LRTI) was not met per protocol criteria for efficacy (i.e. 97.52% lower bound >30%), vaccine efficacy was 39.4% (97.52% CI: -1.0, 63.7%; p=0.0278) in infants 0-90 days age. Furthermore, there was a 58.8% (95% CI 31.9, 75.0%) lower rate of RSV LRTI with severe hypoxemia (secondary endpoint) through to 90 days of age in the expanded intent-to-treat analysis. The number of women needed to be vaccinated to prevent RSV-specific MS-LRTI or LRTI with severe hypoxemia in their infants through to 180 days of life were 88 and 82, respectively. Background: RSV is the dominant cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in infants, with most severe disease concentrated in younger-age infants. Methods: Healthy, pregnant women between 28 and 36 weeks gestation, with expected delivery near the start of the RSV season, were randomized to a single intramuscular dose of nanoparticle RSV F-protein vaccine, or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Their infants were followed for 180 days for medically-significant LRTI (MS-LRTI), LRTI with severe hypoxemia and/or LRTI- hospitalization. RSV detection was performed centrally by PCR. Safety evaluation continued until 364 days age. Results: 4,636 women were randomized, with 4,579 live births. Over the first 90 days of life, efficacy against RSV-MS-LRTI was 39.4% (97.52%CI: -1.0, 63.7%; p=0.0278) and 41.4% (95%CI: 5.3, 61.2%) in the per protocol and expanded intent-to-treat (eITT) analyses, respectively. There was a lower rate (efficacy 58.8%; 95%CI 31.9, 75.0% in eITT analysis; not adjusted for multiplicity) of RSV-LRTI with severe hypoxemia in infants of vaccinees through 90 days age. Pneumonia reported as a serious adverse events was 49.4% less common in infants of vaccinees (2.6%) than placebo-recipients through 364 days age. Conclusions: Maternal vaccination with RSV F-nanoparticle vaccine was safe and immunogenic. The prespecified primary endpoint success criterion (efficacy 97.5% lower bound ≥30%) was not achieved. However, maternal immunization was associated with reduced risk of RSV-confirmed MS-LRTI and LRTI with severe hypoxemia in early infancy. Trial Registration Number: ClinicalTrials.Gov: NCT02624947.

            "abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Inactivated influenza virus vaccines (IIVs) are recommended for all pregnant women in the United States. We conducted a prospective, randomized, double blind study of three licensed seasonal trivalent IIVs (IIV3s) to assess their safety and immunogenicity in pregnant women and determine the level and persistence of passively transferred maternal antibody in infants. STUDY DESIGN: 139 pregnant women ages 18-39 years and 14-33 weeks' gestation, and 44 non-pregnant women, were randomized 1:1:1 to receive a single intramuscular dose of one of three licensed IIV3s (Agriflu®, Fluzone®, or Fluarix®) prior to the 2010-2011 influenza season. Reactogenicity, adverse events (AEs) and pregnancy outcomes were documented. Serum samples for hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and neutralization antibody assays were collected prior to and 28 and 180 days after immunization. Maternal sera and cord blood were collected at the time of delivery and sera were obtained from 44 infants at 6 weeks of age. RESULTS: Pregnant and non-pregnant women experienced similar frequency of injection site (92% and 86%, respectively) and systemic (95% and 87%, respectively) reactions, the majority of which were mild. There were no vaccine-associated maternal or infant serious AEs. Antibody responses to the three vaccine antigens were not different between pregnant and non-pregnant women. The ratios of cord blood (infant) to maternal HAI antibody titers at delivery ranged between 1.1 and 1.7 for each of the vaccine antigens. Influenza antibody concentrations in infants were 70-40% of the birth titer by 6 weeks of age. CONCLUSIONS: The three IIV3s were well tolerated in pregnant women. Antibody responses were comparable in pregnant and non-pregnant women, and after second or third trimester vaccination. Transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies to the infant was efficient. However, antibody titers decline rapidly in the first 6 weeks of life.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a multicenter, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial comparing 5% monolaurin vaginal gel to vehicle placebo (glycol-based) gel administered twice daily for 3 days. Nonpregnant, nonbreastfeeding women between ages 18 and 50 years were recruited and BV confirmed. Primary outcome was clinical cure assessed by resolution of all 4 Amsel criteria. Secondary outcomes included safety and tolerability assessed by solicited urogenital adverse events. Exploratory outcomes included colony counts for vaginal microbes associated with healthy vaginal flora (Lactobacillus species) and the dysbiosis often associated with BV (Gardnerella species and Mobiluncus species). A 2:1 test article to placebo randomization scheme was planned. RESULTS: One hundred nine women participated with 73 randomized to the treatment arm and 36 to the placebo arm. There was no significant difference in clinical cure for BV (p = .42) with 17% of the monolaurin group and 25% of the placebo group achieving clinical cure. Lactobacilli species counts increased in the monolaurin group compared with placebo (1.0 × 10 vs -5.2 × 10). Two thirds of both groups reported solicited urogenital adverse events, but these were mild to moderate with no significant difference between groups (p = .24). CONCLUSIONS: Monolaurin was no more clinically or microbiologically effective than placebo in curing BV. Future research should explore whether monolaurin may be used to increase Lactobacilli species.",

            "abstract":"Administration of vaccines during pregnancy provides maternal protection against infectious diseases. This protection is extended to their infants during the first months of life, as pathogen-specific antibodies formed in response to maternal vaccination are transferred across the placenta to the fetus. Notably, Tdap (tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis) vaccination booster is routinely administered to pregnant women both to prevent neonatal tetanus and to ensure that infants have protective levels of pertussis antibodies until they are able to establish their own vaccine-induced levels. Whether infant protection through maternal immunization is merely due to an increase in maternal antibody levels or whether maternal immunization enhances the transfer of vaccine-specific antibodies is unclear. Moreover, the potential impact of prenatal vaccinations on the transplacental transfer of other antibodies, such as antibodies raised as a result of infections or other vaccines administered prior to pregnancy, has not been studied. The goal of this study was to define the impact of maternal vaccination on IgG transplacental transfer efficiency. We analyzed antigen-specific antibody populations and IgG subclass distribution in maternal and cord blood samples from 58 mother-infant pairs. All women received the seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine during pregnancy and 25 women received the Tdap vaccine during the second or third trimester of gestation. Prenatal Tdap vaccination did not impact the efficiency of IgG transplacental transfer; however, it was associated with higher maternal and infant vaccine-elicited Tdap-specific antibody levels, and with a higher proportion of infants with protective levels of antibodies, especially against diphtheria. There was also no difference in the IgG transplacental transfer rate of antibodies against non-Tdap vaccines between the two groups of women. Our results confirm previous reports demonstrating the benefits of prenatal Tdap immunization and indicate that this strategy does not impede the transplacental transfer of other antibodies that are also important for infant protection.",

            "abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Smoking during pregnancy poses serious risks to baby and mother. Few disseminable programs exist to help pregnant women quit or reduce their smoking. We hypothesized that an SMS text-delivered scheduled gradual reduction (SGR) program plus support texts would outperform SMS support messages alone. METHODS: We recruited 314 pregnant women from 14 prenatal clinics. Half of the women received theory-based support messages throughout their pregnancy to promote cessation and prevent relapse. The other half received the support messages plus alert texts that gradually reduced their smoking more than 3-5 weeks. We conducted surveys at baseline, end of pregnancy, and 3 months postpartum. Our primary outcome was biochemically validated 7-day point prevalence abstinence at late pregnancy. Our secondary outcome was reduction in cigarettes per day. RESULTS: Adherence to the SGR was adequate with 70% responding to alert texts to smoke within 60 minutes. Women in both arms quit smoking at the same rate (9%-12%). Women also significantly reduced their smoking from baseline to the end of pregnancy from nine cigarettes to four; we found no arm differences in reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Support text messages alone produced significant quit rates above naturally occurring quitting. SGR did not add significantly to helping women quit or reduce. Sending support messages can reach many women and is low-cost. More obstetric providers might consider having patients who smoke sign up for free texting programs to help them quit. IMPLICATIONS: A disseminable texting program helped some pregnant women quit smoking.Clinical Trial Registration number: NCT01995097.",

METHOD: We collected demographic and health disparities knowledge information from OB/GYN providers who were members of ACOG District IV using an online survey (n = 483). We examined differences across groups using statistical tests and regression analyses in a structural equation modeling approach. RESULTS: Receiving disparities education was positively associated with higher self-reported disparities knowledge and disparities quiz performance (p < 0.05). African American/Black providers had higher quiz scores than their white counterparts, and providers varied in their levels of disparities knowledge across practice settings (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Differences in levels of knowledge of racial/ethnic disparities in health and healthcare outcomes among OB/GYN providers varied across race/ethnicity, practice context, and whether providers had received formal disparities education. Future research should explore these differences at a population level and develop interventions to improve health disparities education among OB/GYN providers.",

            "abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To characterize hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) exposure in patients with rheumatic disease receiving longterm HCQ compared to target concentrations with reported antiviral activity against the coronavirus disease 2019 caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). METHODS: We evaluated total HCQ concentrations in serum and plasma from published literature values, frozen serum samples from a pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus trial, and simulated concentrations using a published pharmacokinetic model during pregnancy. For each source, we compared observed or predicted HCQ concentrations to target concentrations with reported antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The average total serum/plasma HCQ concentrations were below the lowest SARS-CoV-2 target of 0.48 mg/l in all studies. Assuming the highest antiviral target exposure (total plasma concentration of 4.1 mg/l), all studies had about one-tenth the necessary concentration for in vitro viral inhibition. Pharmacokinetic model simulations confirmed that pregnant adults receiving common dosing for rheumatic diseases did not achieve target exposures; however, the models predict that a dosage of 600 mg once a day during pregnancy would obtain the lowest median target exposure for most patients after the first dose. CONCLUSION: We found that the average patient receiving treatment with HCQ for rheumatic diseases, including children and non-pregnant/pregnant adults, are unlikely to achieve total serum or plasma concentrations shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Nevertheless, patients receiving HCQ long term may have tissue concentrations far exceeding that of serum/plasma. Because the therapeutic window for HCQ in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, well-designed clinical trials that include patients with rheumatic disease are urgently needed to characterize the efficacy, safety, and target exposures for HCQ.",

            "abstract":"BACKGROUND: Although induction of labor of low-risk nulliparous women at 39 weeks reduces the risk of cesarean delivery compared with expectant management, concern regarding more frequent use of labor induction remains, given that this intervention historically has been thought to incur greater resource utilization. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine whether planned elective labor induction at 39 weeks among low-risk nulliparous women, compared with expectant management, was associated with differences in health care resource utilization from the time of randomization through 8 weeks postpartum. STUDY DESIGN: This is a planned secondary analysis of a multicenter randomized trial in which low-risk nulliparous women were assigned to induction of labor at 39 weeks or expectant management. We assessed resource utilization after randomization in 3 time periods: antepartum, delivery admission, and discharge through 8 weeks postpartum. RESULTS: Of 6096 women with data available, those in the induction of labor group (n = 3059) were significantly less likely in the antepartum period after randomization to have at least 1 ambulatory visit for routine prenatal care (32.4% vs 68.4%), unanticipated care (0.5% vs 2.6%), or urgent care (16.2% vs 44.3%), or at least 1 antepartum hospitalization (0.8% vs 2.2%, P < .001 for all). They also had fewer tests (eg, sonograms, blood tests) and treatments (eg, antibiotics, intravenous hydration) prior to delivery. During the delivery admission, women in the induction of labor group spent a longer time in labor and delivery (median, 0.83 vs 0.57 days), but both women (P = .002) and their neonates (P < .001) had shorter postpartum stays. Women and neonates in both groups had similar frequencies of postpartum urgent care and hospital readmissions (P > .05 for all). CONCLUSION: Women randomized to induction of labor had longer durations in labor and delivery but significantly fewer antepartum visits, tests, and treatments and shorter maternal and neonatal hospital durations after delivery. These results demonstrate that the health outcome advantages associated with induction of labor are gained without incurring uniformly greater health care resource use.",

            "abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Most pregnant women know that smoking poses serious risks to baby and mother, yet many still smoke. We conducted a large randomized controlled trial and found that an SMS text-delivered program helped about 10% of these women quit smoking. In this paper, we describe the feasibility of disseminating a text-based intervention to pregnant women who smoke. METHODS: We tested dissemination in two ways from prenatal clinics and compared recruitment rates to those found in our large randomized controlled trial. The first method involved \"direct texting\" where study staff identified women who smoked and sent them a text asking them to text back if they wanted to receive texts to help them quit. The second involved \"nurse screening\" where clinic staff from county health departments screened women for smoking and asked them to send a text to the system if they wanted to learn more about the program. Our primary outcome was feasibility assessed by the number of women who texted back their baby's due date, which served as \"enrolling\" in the texting program, which we compared to the recruitment rate we found in our large trial. RESULTS: Over 4 months, we texted 91 women from the academic health system. Of those, 17 texted back and were counted as \"enrolled.\" In the health departments, across the 4 months, 12 women texted the system initially. Of those, 10 were enrolled. This rate was similar to the rate enrolled in the randomized controlled trial. DISCUSSION: Two different methods connected pregnant women who smoke to a texting program. One of these methods can be automated further and have the potential of helping many women quit smoking with minimal effort. Clinical Trial # NCT01995097.",

METHODS: The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network initiated an observational study of mother-to-child transmission of HCV in 2012 that included offering HCV antibody screening to their entire obstetric population. Women presenting for prenatal care before 23 weeks of gestation without a known multifetal gestation were eligible. For each woman who was HCV antibody-positive, two women at similar gestational age who were HCV antibody-negative were identified and included for comparison. Risk factors were evaluated by patient interview and chart review. Women in the case group were identified to have a signal-to-cutoff value of at least 5 on the Abbott ARCHITECT platform. RNA status was evaluated for women in the case group. RESULTS: Of 106,842 women screened for the HCV antibody, 254 had positive results. The HCV antibody seroprevalence rate was 2.4 cases per 1,000 women (95% CI 2.1-2.7). One hundred thirty-one women in the case group and 251 women in the control group were included in the case-control analysis. Factors associated with HCV antibody positivity included injection drug use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 22.9, 95% CI 8.2-64.0), blood transfusion (aOR 3.7, 95% CI 1.3-10.4), having a partner with HCV (aOR 6.3, 95% CI 1.8-22.6), more than three lifetime sexual partners (aOR 5.3, 95% CI 1.4-19.8), and smoking (aOR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.6). A composite of any of these potential risk factors provided the highest sensitivity for detecting HCV antibody (75/82 cases, 91%). CONCLUSION: In this cohort, the seroprevalence of HCV antibody was low, and the current risk factors for HCV screening were not identified. These findings may be useful in defining new strategies for identifying mothers with the HCV antibody and the neonates susceptible to maternal transmission of HCV.

STUDY DESIGN: The present study is a secondary analysis of a randomized trial of singleton pregnancies at 340/7 to 365/7 weeks' gestation. We included women in spontaneous preterm labor with intact membranes and compared them by gestational age at delivery (preterm vs. term). We calculated a statistical cut-point optimizing the sensitivity and specificity of initial cervical dilation and effacement at predicting preterm birth and used multivariable regression to identify factors associated with late preterm delivery. RESULTS: A total of 431 out of 732 (59%) women delivered preterm. Cervical dilation ≥ 4 cm was 60% sensitive and 68% specific for late preterm birth. Cervical effacement ≥ 75% was 59% sensitive and 65% specific for late preterm birth. Earlier gestational age at randomization, nulliparity, and fetal malpresentation were associated with late preterm birth. The final regression model including clinical and examination features significantly improved late preterm birth prediction (81% sensitivity, 48% specificity, area under the curve = 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.68-0.75, and p-value < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Four in 10 women in late-preterm labor subsequently delivered at term. Combination of examination and clinical features (including parity and gestational age) improved late-preterm birth prediction.",

METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of data from a multicenter randomized controlled trial of elective induction of labor at 39 weeks of gestation in low-risk nulliparous women. In this trial, women completed the Labor Agentry Scale, a validated measure of women's feelings of control over the childbirth process, 6-96 hours after delivery. The Labor Agentry Scale score, which is higher with more perceived control during childbirth, was analyzed both as a continuous and a categorical variable (quintiles). Self-reported breastfeeding at 4-8 weeks postpartum was categorized as exclusive breastfeeding, breastfeeding and formula feeding, or exclusive formula feeding. Women were included in this analysis if they labored, filled out a Labor Agentry Scale questionnaire, had a neonate who survived until the postpartum visit, and provided information on infant feeding. Multinomial logistic regression was used to adjust for confounders. RESULTS: Of 5,185 women, 32.9% (n=1,705) were exclusively breastfeeding, 31.2% (n=1,620) were breastfeeding and formula feeding, and 35.9% (n=1,860) were exclusively formula feeding 4-8 weeks after delivery. Overall Labor Agentry Scale score ranged from 34 to 203 (median 167, interquartile range 145-182). The median Labor Agentry Scale score was 169 (interquartile range 151-183) for women exclusively breastfeeding, 166 (interquartile range 142-182) for women who were breastfeeding and formula feeding, and 164 (interquartile range 142-181) for women who were only formula feeding (P<.001). In the unadjusted multinomial model, women with Labor Agentry Scale scores in the lowest two quintiles (ie, those with lower perceived control during childbirth) were less likely to be exclusively breastfeeding (as compared with those exclusively formula feeding) than women in the highest Labor Agentry Scale quintile. When controlling for confounders, however, this association was no longer significant. CONCLUSION: After adjustment for confounders, perceived control during childbirth was not associated with breastfeeding at 4-8 weeks postpartum among nulliparous women.

            "abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Weekly 17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17OHP-C) from 16 to 36 weeks' gestation reduces the risk of recurrent spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB). Limited data suggest poor adherence to published guidelines. This study aimed to identify factors associated with 17OHP-C utilization. STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study included women with a singleton pregnancy who delivered within one academic health system between January 2014 and December 2015. Eligible women had a history of ≥1 singleton sPTB. Primary outcomes were counseling about, receipt of, and adherence to 17OHP-C therapy. Demographic and clinical predictors of the primary outcomes were determined using stepwise logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 410 eligible subjects, 69% (N = 284) were counseled about and 36% (N = 148) received 17OHP-C. Hispanic ethnicity, delay in prenatal care initiation, and a history of prior term births were associated with lower odds of 17OHP-C counseling. Each week delay in prenatal care initiation, Hispanic ethnicity, and each additional week's gestation of the earliest prior sPTB decreased the odds of receiving 17OHP-C. Maternal age and prior term births were associated with adherence. CONCLUSION: Utilization of evidence-based 17OHP-C therapy remains suboptimal: cultural and access-to-care barriers for eligible women may impede efforts to decrease recurrent sPTB rates.",

The PBHS is a prospective, multicenter, longitudinal cohort study that aims to enroll thousands of participants with diverse backgrounds who are representative of the entire health spectrum. Enrolled participants will be evaluated serially using clinical, molecular, imaging, sensor, self-reported, behavioral, psychological, environmental, and other health-related measurements. An initial deeply phenotyped cohort will inform the development of a large, expanded virtual cohort. The PBHS will contribute to precision health and medicine by integrating state of the art testing, longitudinal monitoring and participant engagement, and by contributing to the development of an improved platform for data sharing and analysis.",

            "abstract":"BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of infant lower respiratory tract disease and hospitalization worldwide. METHODS: Safety and immunogenicity of RSV fusion (F) protein nanoparticle vaccine or placebo were evaluated in 50 healthy third-trimester pregnant women. Assessments included vaccine tolerability and safety in women and infants, and RSV-specific antibody measures in women before and after vaccination, at delivery and post partum. RESULTS: The vaccine was well tolerated; no meaningful differences in pregnancy or infant outcomes were observed between study groups. RSV-specific antibody levels increased significantly among vaccine recipients, including responses competitive with well-described monoclonal antibodies specific for multiple RSV neutralizing epitopes. No significant antibody increase was seen among placebo recipients, although a shallow upward trend across the RSV season was noted. Transplacental antibody transfer was 90%-120% across assays for infants of vaccinated women. Women with an interval of ≥30 days between vaccination and delivery demonstrated higher placental antibody transfer rates than women with an interval <30 days. Half-lives of RSV-specific antibodies in infants approximated 40 days. There was no evidence of severe RSV disease in infants of vaccinated mothers. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this phase 2 study support a maternal immunization strategy to protect infants from RSV disease. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT02247726.",

            "abstract":"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a newly-identified infectious cause of congenital disease. Transplacental transfer of maternal IgG to the fetus plays an important role in preventing many neonatal infections. However, antibody transfer may also have negative consequences, such as mediating enhancement of flavivirus infections in early life, or trafficking of virus immune complexes to the fetal compartment. ZIKV infection produces placental pathology which could lead to impaired IgG transfer efficiency as occurs in other maternal infections, such as HIV-1 and malaria. In this study, we asked whether ZIKV infection during pregnancy impairs transplacental transfer of IgG. We enrolled pregnant women with fever or rash in a prospective cohort in Vitoria, Brazil during the recent ZIKV epidemic. ZIKV and dengue virus (DENV)-specific IgG, ZIKV and DENV neutralizing antibodies, and routine vaccine antigen-specific IgG were measured in maternal samples collected around delivery and 20 paired cord blood samples. We concluded that 8 of these mothers were infected with ZIKV during pregnancy and 12 were ZIKV-uninfected. The magnitude of flavivirus-specific IgG, neutralizing antibody, and vaccine-elicited IgG were highly correlated between maternal plasma and infant cord blood in both ZIKV-infected and -uninfected mother-infant pairs. Moreover, there was no difference in the magnitude of plasma flavivirus-specific IgG levels between mothers and infants regardless of ZIKV infection status. Our data suggests that maternal ZIKV infection during pregnancy does not impair the efficiency of placental transfer of flavivirus-specific, functional, and vaccine-elicited IgG. These findings have implications for the neonatal outomes of maternal ZIKV infection and optimal administration of antibody-based ZIKV vaccines and therapeutics.",

            "abstract":"BACKGROUND: West Nile virus (WNV) is the most common mosquito-borne infection in the United States. HydroVax-001 WNV is a hydrogen peroxide inactivated, whole virion (WNV-Kunjin strain) vaccine adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide. METHODS: We performed a phase 1, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind (within dosing group), dose escalation clinical trial of the HydroVax-001 WNV vaccine administered via intramuscular injection. This trial evaluated 1 mcg and 4 mcg dosages of HydroVax-001 WNV vaccine given intramuscularly on day 1 and day 29 in healthy adults. The two dosing groups of HydroVax-001 were enrolled sequentially and each group consisted of 20 individuals who received HydroVax-001 and 5 who received placebo. Safety was assessed at all study days (days 1, 2, 4 and 15 post dose 1, and days 1, 2, 4, 15, 29, 57, 180 and 365 post dose 2), and reactogenicity was assessed for 14 days after administration of each dose. Immunogenicity was measured by WNV-specific plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT50) in the presence or absence of added complement or by WNV-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). RESULTS: HydroVax-001 was safe and well-tolerated as there were no serious adverse events or concerning safety signals. At the 1 mcg dose, HydroVax-001 was not immunogenic by PRNT50 but elicited up to 41% seroconversion by WNV-specific ELISA in the per-protocol population (PP) after the second dose. At the 4 mcg dose, HydroVax-001 elicited neutralizing antibody responses in 31% of the PP following the second dose. In the presence of added complement, PRNT50 seroconversion rates increased to 50%, and 75% seroconversion was observed by WNV-specific ELISA. CONCLUSIONS: The HydroVax-001 WNV vaccine was found to be modestly immunogenic and well-tolerated at all dose levels.",

There is also little published evidence of RCR programs addressing high-profile, internal cases of misconduct as a way of promoting deliberation and learning. In the wake of major research misconduct, Duke University School of Medicine (DUSoM) expanded its RCR education activities to include all DUSoM faculty and staff engaged in research. The program included formal deliberation of the Translational Omics misconduct case, which occurred at Duke. Over 5,000 DUSoM faculty and staff participated in the first phase of this new program, with a 100% completion rate. The article reports on the program's development, challenges and successes, and future directions. This experience at Duke University illustrates that, although challenging and resource intensive, engagement with RCR activities can be integrated into programs for all research faculty and staff. Formal, participatory deliberation of recent cases of internal misconduct can add a novel dimension of reflection and openness to RCR educational activities.",

            "abstract":"INTRODUCTION: To reduce the risk of recurrence, women with a history of spontaneous preterm birth (PTB) are recommended to receive 17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17-P) injections starting by the 20th week of pregnancy. In women eligible for 17-P, we aimed to identify patient factors and geospatial locations associated with increased risk of presentation beyond 20 weeks gestation. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of a retrospective cohort study including all women meeting criteria for 17-P within a single academic medical center over a 2-year period. We compared early (< 20 6/7 weeks) with late (> 21 weeks) presenters via demographics, social history, and index pregnancy outcomes using standard and Bayesian statistical models. Geospatial mapping was performed to determine residential areas with high risk for late presentation. RESULTS: Geocoded address data was available for 351 women in whom the mean gestational age at first visit was 14.9 weeks, and 63 of whom were late presenters (17.9%). Younger maternal age, current smoking, and lack of health insurance were predictors of late presentation with greater than 95% probability. Hispanic ethnicity and black race were associated with higher odds of late presentation with 87 and 69% probability, respectively. The area with the latest gestational age at presentation was located within central Durham City and to the northeast. DISCUSSION: Our study identified patient-level risk factors and geographic locations associated with presentation beyond the recommend window for 17-P initiation. These findings suggest an urgent need for intervention to improve early prenatal care initiation and a target location where such interventions will be most impactful.",

            "abstract":"Importance: Administration of corticosteroids to women at high risk for delivery in the late preterm period (34-36 weeks' gestation) improves short-term neonatal outcomes. The cost implications of this intervention are not known. Objective: To compare the cost-effectiveness of treatment with antenatal corticosteroids with no treatment for women at risk for late preterm delivery. Design, Setting, and Participants: This secondary analysis of the Antenatal Late Preterm Steroids trial, a multicenter randomized clinical trial of antenatal corticosteroids vs placebo in women at risk for late preterm delivery conducted from October 30, 2010, to February 27, 2015. took a third-party payer perspective. Maternal costs were based on Medicaid rates and included those of betamethasone, as well as the outpatient visits or inpatient stay required to administer betamethasone. All direct medical costs for newborn care were included. For infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, comprehensive daily costs were stratified by the acuity of respiratory illness. For infants admitted to the regular newborn nursery, nationally representative cost estimates from the literature were used. Effectiveness was measured as the proportion of infants without the primary outcome of the study: a composite of treatment in the first 72 hours of continuous positive airway pressure or high-flow nasal cannula for 2 hours or more, supplemental oxygen with a fraction of inspired oxygen of 30% or more for 4 hours or more, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or mechanical ventilation. This secondary analysis was initially started in June 2016 and revision of the analysis began in May 2017. Exposures: Betamethasone treatment. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Results: Costs were determined for 1426 mother-infant pairs in the betamethasone group (mean [SD] maternal age, 28.6 [6.3] years; 827 [58.0%] white) and 1395 mother-infant pairs in the placebo group (mean [SD] maternal age, 27.9 [6.2] years; 794 [56.9%] white). Treatment with betamethasone was associated with a total mean (SD) woman-infant-pair cost of $4681 ($5798), which was significantly less than the mean (SD) amount of $5379 ($8422) for women and infants in the placebo group (difference, $698; 95% CI, $186-$1257; P = .02). The Antenatal Late Preterm Steroids trial determined that betamethasone use is effective: respiratory morbidity decreased by 2.9% (95% CI, -0.5% to -5.4%). Thus, the cost-effectiveness ratio was -$23 986 per case of respiratory morbidity averted. Inspection of the bootstrap replications confirmed that treatment was the dominant strategy in 5000 samples (98.8%). Sensitivity analyses showed that these results held under most assumptions. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that antenatal betamethasone treatment is associated with a statistically significant decrease in health care costs and with improved outcomes; thus, this treatment may be an economically desirable strategy.",

            "abstract":"Objective  To examine the association between perioperative Beta ( β ))-lactam versus non- β -lactam antibiotics and cesarean delivery surgical site infection (SSI). Study Design  Retrospective cohort of women undergoing cesarean delivery from January 1 to December 31, 2014. All women undergoing cesarean after 34 weeks with a postpartum visit were included. Prevalence of SSI was compared between women receiving β -lactam versus non- β -lactam antibiotics. Bivariate analyses were performed using Pearson's Chi-square, Fisher's exact, or Wilcoxon's rank-sum tests. Logistic regression models were fit controlling for possible confounders. Results  Of the 929 women included, 826 (89%) received β -lactam prophylaxis and 103 (11%) received a non- β -lactam. Among the 893 women who reported a non-type I (low risk) allergy, 819 (92%) received β -lactam prophylaxis. SSI occurred in 7% of women who received β -lactam antibiotics versus 15% of women who received a non- β -lactam ( p  = 0.004). β -Lactam prophylaxis was associated with lower odds of SSI compared with non- β -lactam antibiotics (odds ratio [OR] = 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.22-0.83; p  = 0.01) after controlling for chorioamnionitis in labor, postlabor cesarean, endometritis, tobacco use, and body mass index (BMI). Conclusion   β -Lactam perioperative prophylaxis is associated with lower odds of a cesarean delivery surgical site infection compared with non- β -lactam antibiotics.",

            "abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the costs, complication rates, and harm-benefit tradeoffs of induction of labor (IOL) compared to scheduled cesarean delivery (CD) in women with class III obesity. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a cost analysis of IOL versus scheduled CD in nulliparous morbidly obese women. Primary outcomes were surgical site infection (SSI), chorioamnionitis, venous thromboembolism, blood transfusion, and readmission. Model outcomes were mean cost of each strategy, cost per complication avoided, and complication tradeoffs. We assessed the costs, complication rates, and harm-benefit tradeoffs of IOL compared with scheduled CD in women with class III obesity. RESULTS: A total of 110 patients underwent scheduled CD and 114 underwent IOL, of whom 61 (54%) delivered via cesarean. The group delivering vaginally experienced fewer complications. SSI occurred in 0% in the vaginal delivery group, 13% following scheduled cesarean, and 16% following induction then cesarean. In the decision model, the mean cost of induction was $13,349 compared with $14,575 for scheduled CD. Scheduled CD costs $9,699 per case of chorioamnionitis avoided, resulted in 18 cases of chorioamnionitis avoided per additional SSI and 3 cases of chorioamnionitis avoided per additional hospital readmission. In sensitivity analysis, IOL is cost saving compared with scheduled CD unless the cesarean rate following induction exceeds 70%. CONCLUSION: In morbidly obese women, induction of labor remains cost-saving until the rate of cesarean following induction exceeds 70%.",

            "abstract":"Pregnant women are highly susceptible to Plasmodium falciparum malaria, leading to substantial maternal, perinatal, and infant mortality. While malaria vaccine development has made significant progress in recent years, no trials of malaria vaccines have ever been conducted in pregnant women. In December 2016, an expert meeting was convened at NIAID, NIH, in Rockville, Maryland to deliberate on the rationale and design of malaria vaccine trials in pregnant women. The discussions highlighted the progress made over recent years in the field of maternal immunization for other infectious diseases, and the evolving regulatory and ethical environment, all of which support a new emphasis on testing malaria vaccines that offer direct benefits to pregnant women. Initial safety and immunogenicity studies of malaria vaccines will be conducted in non-pregnant adult volunteers. Subsequently, efficacy trials involving pregnant women will likely be conducted in malaria-endemic and often resource-poor environments where sufficiently high malaria incidence will allow vaccine activity to be measured. Such trials will need to meet all international standards to ensure the safety of mother and offspring, under oversight of appropriate ethical and regulatory bodies. The convened experts drafted a clinical development plan to test a malaria vaccine product during pregnancy, using as a case study PfSPZ Vaccine being developed by Sanaria Inc. that is currently in phase 2 testing. Following the expert recommendations, a pregnancy registry has been initiated in Ouelessebougou, Mali, to provide baseline information on maternal and fetal outcomes as a context for evaluating PfSPZ Vaccine safety in the future, and new regimens are being assessed that will be suitable for evaluation in pregnant women.",

            "abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To assess neonatal respiratory morbidity in pregnancies with and without gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) at imminent risk of late preterm delivery in a modern U.S. cohort. METHODS: Secondary analysis of a randomized placebo-controlled trial in which women with singleton pregnancies at high risk for delivery between 34 0/7 and 36 5/7 weeks of gestation were allocated to betamethasone or placebo. The primary outcome for the trial and this secondary analysis was a composite outcome of neonatal respiratory morbidity in the first 72 hours of life. Secondary outcomes included neonatal severe respiratory complications, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission greater than or equal to 3 days, and hyperbilirubinemia. We examined associations between neonatal morbidities and GDM status after adjustment for baseline differences and study group allocation using modified Poisson regression. Models incorporating a product interaction term between GDM status and treatment arm (betamethasone or placebo) were also evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 2,831 women enrolled in the trial, 306 (10.8%) had GDM. Women with GDM were significantly older and were more likely to be parous and to have hypertensive disorders of pregnancy than those without GDM, but they were similar regarding race, gestational age at randomization (35.6 weeks) and at delivery (36.1 weeks), and study group assignment. Neonates born to women with GDM were no more likely to meet the primary outcome than those born to women without GDM, even after adjusting for differences in age, parity, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (12.1% vs 13.1%, adjusted RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.61-1.17), nor were they more likely to have severe respiratory complications or prolonged NICU admission. CONCLUSION: Maternal GDM is not associated with increased neonatal respiratory morbidity in this study population who were at high risk for late preterm birth.",

            "abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We examined the effects of magnesium sulfate on non-neurologic neonatal outcomes with respect to cord blood magnesium level. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a secondary analysis of the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Beneficial Effects of Antenatal Magnesium (MFMU BEAM) trial comparing the upper and lower quintiles of cord blood magnesium level. Outcomes included cerebral palsy (CP), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and assessments of mental and motor disability. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of each outcome, controlling for gestational age (GA), birth weight, and treatment group (TG). RESULTS: A total of 1,254 women of the 2,444 included in the BEAM trial had cord blood magnesium levels recorded. GA and birth weight were lower and TG was more common in the upper quintile cohort (p < 0.001). Neonates in the upper quintile were more likely to have severe NEC (OR, 2.41, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-5.24), ROP (OR, 1.65, 95% CI: 1.05-2.59), and BPD (OR, 1.70, 95% CI: 1.04-2.73). Adjustment for covariates demonstrated no difference in the NEC, ROP, and BPD rates, although there was a decrease in rates of mental disability index < 70 which was not seen in the unadjusted analysis (aOR, 0.49, 95% CI: 0.25-0.99). CONCLUSION: Higher cord blood magnesium levels do not appear to have adverse non-neurologic effects on the neonate and may demonstrate improvement in neurologic outcomes.",

            "abstract":"Background: Maternal GBS colonization is associated with early-onset neonatal sepsis and extensive efforts are directed to preventing this complication. Less is known about maternal risks of GBS colonization. We seek to provide a modern estimate of the incidence and impact of maternal GBS colonization and invasive GBS disease. Methods: A single center historical cohort study of all births between 2003 and 2015 was performed. Data was collected via electronic health record abstraction using an institutional specific tool. Descriptive statistics were performed regarding GBS status. Inferential statistics were performed comparing risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in cohorts with and without GBS colonization as well as cohorts with GBS colonization and invasive GBS disease. Results: A total of 60,029 deliveries were included for analysis. Overall, 21.6% of the population was GBS colonized and 0.1% had invasive GBS disease. GBS colonization was associated with younger maternal age, Black race, non-Hispanic ethnicity, chronic hypertension, preexisting diabetes, and tobacco use (p<0.01). In the adjusted analyses, there was an increased risk of gestational diabetes (aRR 1.21, 95% CI 1.11-1.32) in colonized pregnancies and a decreased incidence of short cervix (aRR 0.64, 95% CI 0.52-0.79), chorioamnionitis (aRR 0.76, 95% CI 0.66-0.87), wound infection (aRR 0.75, 95% CI 0.64-0.88), and operative delivery (aRR 0.85, 95% CI 0.83-0.88). Conclusions: This modern-day large cohort of all births over a 12-year period demonstrates a GBS colonization rate of 21.6%. This data reflects a need to assess maternal and perinatal outcomes in addition to neonatal GBS sepsis rates to inform decisions regarding the utility of maternal vaccination.",

            "abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Despite vaccination, there were more than 100,000 annual cases of varicella in the United States in 2013-2014. Individuals at highest risk of developing severe or complicated varicella include immunocompromised people, preterm infants, and pregnant women. Varicella zoster immune globulin (human) (VARIZIG) is recommended by the CDC for postexposure prophylaxis to prevent or attenuate varicella-zoster virus infection in high-risk individuals. Contemporary information on administration of VARIZIG is limited. METHODS: This open-label, expanded-access program provided VARIZIG to physician-identified, high-risk participants exposed to varicella. Participants included immunocompromised children/adults, infants (preterm, newborns whose mothers had varicella onset within 5 days before or 2 days after delivery, and those aged <1 year), and pregnant women. VARIZIG (125 IU/10 kg [up to 625 IU]) was administered intramuscularly, ideally within 96 hours, but up to 10 days, postexposure. Incidence of varicella rash and severity (>100 pox, pneumonia, or encephalitis) were assessed up to 42 days after administration. RESULTS: The varicella outcome population (n = 507) included 263 immunocompromised participants (32 adults, 231 children), 137 pregnant women, 105 infants, and 2 healthy adults with no history of varicella. Varicella incidence was 4.5% in immunocompromised participants, 7.3% in pregnant women, and 11.5% in infants. The incidence of varicella was similar when comparing VARIZIG administration ≤ 96 hours vs > 96 hours (up to 10 days) postexposure in the entire population (6.2% vs. 9.4%, respectively), and also in each subgroup. Of 34 participants with varicella, 5 developed > 100 pox and 1 developed pneumonia and encephalitis. There were no product-related deaths and only 1 serious adverse event (serum sickness) considered probably related to VARIZIG. CONCLUSION: Postexposure administration of VARIZIG was associated with low rates of varicella in high-risk participants, regardless of when administered within 10 days postexposure. VARIZIG was well-tolerated and safe in high-risk participants.",

            "abstract":"Women with a history of a preterm birth (PTB) are at high risk for recurrence. Weekly 17-hydroxyprogestrone caproate (17-P) injections can reduce the risk of recurrence in women with prior spontaneous PTB. PTB occurs disproportionately in non-Hispanic black (NHB) women, and uptake and adherence to 17-P among NHB women are lower compared to women in other racial/ethnic groups. Evidence-based interventions to improve 17-P uptake and adherence that incorporate women's perceptions and preferences are needed. Our objective was to identify women's perspectives and preferences for interventions to promote uptake of and adherence to 17-P, particularly among NHB women. We conducted an exploratory sequential mixed methods study using focus group discussions (FGDs), a survey, and in-depth interviews (IDIs). We recruited women with a history of PTB who self-identified as NHB for the FGDs and IDIs. Survey participation was open to any woman with a history of PTB regardless of their race and ethnicity. Women could only participate in one of the three data collection activities. Transcripts from the qualitative focus groups and in-depth interviews were analyzed using applied thematic analysis. Descriptive statistics was used to analyze the quantitative survey. Eighty-two women participated in the study (FGDs [n = 7], surveys [n = 60], and IDIs [n = 15]). Suggested interventions were separated into two categories: (1) clinic-based interventions (i.e., interventions delivered during the clinical encounter) and (2) community-based interventions (i.e., interventions delivered outside of the clinical encounter). Clinic level interventions included improved clinic access and scheduling, same-day appointments, appointment reminders, making the clinic experience more comfortable for patients, and encouragement from providers. Interventions at the community level included increased 17-P awareness among support persons, employers, and community members and administration of 17-P outside the clinic setting. Our findings offer multiple potential interventions that could improve uptake of and adherence to 17-P for PTB prevention among NHB women. These proposed interventions have the potential to mitigate barriers to 17-P and narrow the disparity in PTB rates. Given the alarming and increasing rates of prematurity and PTB disparities, it is imperative to test, refine, and incorporate effective interventions into clinical practice. Our findings provide insights from patients that can help shape such interventions.",

OBJECTIVE: We conducted a randomized study of two licensed seasonal trivalent IIVs (IIV3) to assess their safety and immunogenicity in pregnant women. STUDY DESIGN: In this prospective, randomized clinical study, 100 pregnant women, 18-39 years of age and ≥14 weeks gestation received a single intramuscular dose of 2008-2009 Fluzone® or Fluarix®. Injection site and systemic reactions were recorded for 7 days after vaccination and serious adverse events (SAEs) and pregnancy outcomes were documented. Serum samples collected before and 28 days after vaccination were tested for hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody levels. RESULTS: The majority of the injection site and systemic reactions were mild and self-limited after both vaccines. No fever ≥100 °F was reported. There were no vaccine-associated SAEs. Immune responses to influenza vaccine antigens were similar for the two study vaccines, with robust HAI responses against influenza A strains, and relatively lower responses for influenza B strains. CONCLUSION: Seasonal inactivated influenza vaccines were well tolerated and immunogenic in pregnant women. SYNOPSIS: In this prospective clinical trial, we demonstrated that immunization with seasonal trivalent, inactivated influenza vaccine in the second and third trimester of pregnancy is immunogenic and safe.",

            "abstract":"Objective Approximately 1 to 2 of every 1000 American newborns has hearing loss identified by newborn screening. This study was designed to determine if infant hearing loss is more common in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. Study Design In this retrospective study, we analyzed electronic medical record data using geostatistical models. Setting Infants were residents of Durham County, North Carolina, born in 2 hospitals of the Duke University Health System. This county includes the city of Durham and surrounding suburban and rural communities. Subjects and Methods Subjects were hearing-screened newborns, born between 2005 and 2016, whose residential address was in Durham County, North Carolina. This was a retrospective study using medical record data. We used Bayesian regression models with smoothing of coordinate date to identify both spatial and nonspatial predictors of infant hearing loss. Results We identified 19,348 infants from Durham County, of whom 675 had failed initial hearing screening and 191 had hearing loss confirmed on follow-up. Hearing loss was significantly associated with minority race (odds ratio [OR], 2.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.97-3.06), as well as lower gestational age and maternal sexually transmitted infections. We identified significant geographic heterogeneity, with a higher probability of hearing loss in poorer urban neighborhoods (local OR range, 0.59-1.39). Neighborhood disadvantage was a significant predictor of hearing loss, as was high local seroprevalence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) among pregnant women. Conclusions Urban, low-income neighborhoods have a high prevalence of infant hearing loss compared with more affluent surrounding communities, particularly among minorities. This distribution may be attributable to congenital CMV infection.",

            "abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertusiss (Tdap) vaccine is recommended during each pregnancy, regardless of prior receipt. Data on reactogenicity and immunogenicity, particularly after repeated Tdap, are limited. We compared local injection-site and systemic reactions and serologic response following Tdap in (1) pregnant and nonpregnant women and (2) pregnant women by self-reported prior Tdap receipt. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant women (gestational age 20-34 weeks) and nonpregnant women receiving Tdap were enrolled in this observational study. Injection-site and systemic reactions were assessed for one week post-vaccination. Pertussis toxin, filamentous hemagglutinin, pertactin, fimbriae, tetanus and diphtheria specific IgG antibody titers were determined by standardized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at baseline and 28 days post-vaccination. Reactogenicity and serologic responses were compared by pregnancy status, and within pregnant women by self-reported prior Tdap receipt. RESULTS: 374 pregnant and 225 nonpregnant women were vaccinated. Severe local or systemic reactions or \"any\" fever were uncommon (≤3% for both groups). Moderate/severe injection-site pain was significantly higher in pregnant (17.9%) versus nonpregnant (11.1%) women, but did not prompt a healthcare visit. Proportions of other moderate/severe or any severe reactions were not significantly higher in pregnant compared to nonpregnant women. Moderate/severe (including pain) and severe reactions were not significantly higher in pregnant women receiving repeat versus first-time Tdap. Antibody titers increased from baseline to post-vaccination for all vaccine antigens in pregnant and nonpregnant women; post-vaccination titers against pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin were significantly higher in nonpregnant versus pregnant women (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Tdap was well-tolerated in pregnant and nonpregnant women. Pregnant women were more likely to report moderate/severe pain at the Tdap injection-site compared with nonpregnant women, but did not necessitate medical visits. Prior Tdap receipt did not increase occurrence of moderate/severe local or systemic reactions in pregnant women. Serologic responses to all vaccine antigens were robust.

STUDY DESIGN: In this study a secondary analysis of the BEAM trial was performed. It included women with singleton, liveborn, and nonanomalous fetuses. Neonatal outcomes were compared in noncephalic versus cephalic presentation. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each outcome with logistic regression while controlling for possible confounders. A stratified analysis by mode of delivery was also performed in this study. RESULTS: A total of 458 noncephalic deliveries were compared with 1,485 cephalic deliveries. In multivariate analysis, noncephalic presentation was associated with increased risk of death in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or death at <15 months corrected gestational age (cGA), and a decreased risk of IVH. The risk of death persisted in stratified analysis, with increased risk of death at <15 months cGA in noncephalic neonates born via cesarean delivery. In the vaginal delivery group, there was an increased risk of death at <15 months cGA and NICU death. CONCLUSION: After controlling for possible confounders, neonates who are noncephalic at delivery have higher risk for death <15 months cGA and death in the NICU while their risk of IVH is reduced.

Our objective was to determine if the relationship between psychosocial stress and PTB is altered by parity. Non-Hispanic black (NHB) women have increased psychosocial stress and PTB; therefore, we further aimed to determine if race alters the relationship between psychosocial stress, parity, and PTB. Methods We performed a secondary analysis of the Healthy Pregnancy, Healthy Baby Study comparing pregnant women who were primiparous (first pregnancy), multiparous with history of preterm birth, or multiparous with history of term birth. Perceived stress, perceived racism, interpersonal support, John Henryism and self-efficacy were measured using validated instruments. Logistic regression was used to model the effect of psychosocial stress on PTB stratified by parity and race. Results The analysis entire cohort included 1606 subjects, 426 were primiparous, 268 had a history of presterm birth, and 912 had a history of term birth. In women with a history of term birth, higher self-efficacy was associated with lower odds of spontaneous PTB, and this association was amplified in NHB women. In women with a history of spontaneous PTB, John Henryism Active Coping was associated with lower odds of spontaneous PTB in the index pregnancy. Conclusions for Practice The relationship between psychosocial stress and PTB may be mediated by parity and race.",

            "abstract":"Many couples tend to report steadily decreasing relationship quality following the birth of a child. However, little is known about the postpartum period for Latino couples, a rapidly growing ethnic group who are notably underserved by mental and physical health caregivers in the United States. Thus, this study investigated whether a brief couples' intervention focused on helping couples support each other while increasing healthy behaviors might improve dyadic functioning postpartum. This study presents secondary analyses of data regarding couple functioning from a larger randomized controlled trial with 348 Latino couples to promote smoking cessation. Portions of the intervention taught the couple communication and problem-solving skills to increase healthy behavior. Couples participated in four face-to-face assessments across 1 year starting at the end of the first trimester. Latent growth curve analyses revealed that the treatment group reported an increase in relationship satisfaction and constructive communication after the intervention, which diminished by 1-year follow-up, returning couples to their baseline levels of satisfaction. Results suggest that incorporating a brief couple intervention as part of a larger health intervention for Latinos may prevent postpartum decreases in relationship satisfaction.",

METHODS: In this multicenter trial, we randomly assigned low-risk nulliparous women who were at 38 weeks 0 days to 38 weeks 6 days of gestation to labor induction at 39 weeks 0 days to 39 weeks 4 days or to expectant management. The primary outcome was a composite of perinatal death or severe neonatal complications; the principal secondary outcome was cesarean delivery. RESULTS: A total of 3062 women were assigned to labor induction, and 3044 were assigned to expectant management. The primary outcome occurred in 4.3% of neonates in the induction group and in 5.4% in the expectant-management group (relative risk, 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64 to 1.00). The frequency of cesarean delivery was significantly lower in the induction group than in the expectant-management group (18.6% vs. 22.2%; relative risk, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.93). CONCLUSIONS: Induction of labor at 39 weeks in low-risk nulliparous women did not result in a significantly lower frequency of a composite adverse perinatal outcome, but it did result in a significantly lower frequency of cesarean delivery.

            "abstract":"BACKGROUND: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common infectious cause of fetal malformations and childhood hearing loss. CMV is more common among socially disadvantaged groups, and geographically clusters in poor communities. The Area Deprivation Index (ADI) is a neighborhood-level index derived from census data that reflects material disadvantage. METHODS: We performed a geospatial analysis to determine if ADI predicts the local odds of CMV seropositivity. We analyzed a dataset of 3527 women who had been tested for CMV antibodies during pregnancy. We used generalized additive models to analyze the spatial distribution of CMV seropositivity. Adjusted models included individual-level age and race and neighborhood-level ADI. RESULTS: Our dataset included 1955 CMV seropositive women, 1549 who were seronegative, and 23 with recent CMV infection based on low avidity CMV antibodies. High ADI percentiles, representing greater neighborhood poverty, were significantly associated with the nonwhite race (48 vs. 22, p < 0.001) and CMV seropositivity (39 vs. 28, p < 0.001). Our unadjusted spatial models identified clustering of high CMV odds in poor, urban neighborhoods and clustering of low CMV odds in more affluent suburbs (local odds ratio 0.41 to 1.90). Adjustment for both individual race and neighborhood ADI largely eliminated this spatial variability. ADI remained a significant predictor of local CMV seroprevalence even after adjusting for individual race. CONCLUSIONS: Neighborhood-level poverty as measured by the ADI is a race-independent predictor of local CMV seroprevalence among pregnant women.",

Little is known about the potential for transmission of LAIV viruses from the mother to the infant and the comparative breast milk antibody responses to LAIV and IIV. METHODS: We performed a randomized, double-blind study comparing the immunogenicity of LAIV to IIV when administered to nursing mothers. The safety of LAIV to IIV in women and their infants was also compared. Women received LAIV + intramuscular placebo, or IIV + intranasal placebo on Day 0. Breast milk and nasal swabs (from women and infants) were collected on Days 0, 2, and 8 for detection of LAIV. Breast milk and serum antibody responses were measured at Days 0 and 28. The primary hypothesis was that LAIV would provide superior induction of breast milk IgA responses to influenza as compared to IIV when administered to nursing mothers. RESULTS: Breast milk IgG, breast milk IgA (H1N1 only), serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI), and serum IgG responses were significantly higher following administration of IIV compared to LAIV. Receipt of either LAIV or IIV was safe in women and their infants. One (1%) LAIV recipient transmitted vaccine virus to her infant who remained well. No influenza virus was detected in breast milk. CONCLUSIONS: Breast milk and serum antibody responses were higher for IIV compared to LAIV. LAIV and IIV were safe for nursing women but there was one (1%) possible transmission of LAIV to an infant. This study suggests that IIV may be the preferred vaccine for nursing mothers.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the BEAM Trial, an RCT to determine if antenatal magnesium decreases the incidence of CP in preterm birth. We compared the effect of magnesium sulfate by the presence or absence of chorioamnionitis. Outcomes examined include CP, IVH, NEC, BPD, and assessments of mental and motor disability. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios of each outcome. RESULTS: About 1944 women were included in this analysis of which 228 were diagnosed with chorioamnionitis. Demographic characteristics were similar between women randomized to receive magnesium or placebo. Magnesium therapy demonstrated no significant reduction in CP in the presence of chorioamnionitis (OR 0.76, CI: 0.19-2.76) but does demonstrate benefit in the absence of chorioamnionitis (OR 0.52, CI: 0.31-0.86). CONCLUSIONS: Antenatal magnesium did not show a clear neuroprotective effect in the setting of chorioamnionitis.",

            "abstract":"Pediatric vaccines have significantly reduced infectious disease-related infant mortality, but as protective immunity often require several infant vaccine doses; maternally-acquired antibodies are critical to protect infants during the first months of life. Consequently, immunization of pregnant women is an important strategy not only to protect mothers from infection, but also to provide immunity to young infants. Nevertheless, maternal immunization can also negatively impact early life immunity. In fact, maternal antibodies can interfere with the development of infant immune responses, though it is unclear if such interference is clinically significant. Moreover, the transplacental transfer of maternal immunoglobulin therapeutics can be harmful to the fetus. Thus, the risk/benefit of maternal immunization for both the mother and the fetus should be carefully weighed. In addition, it is critical to fully understand the mechanisms by which IgG is transferred across the placenta in order to develop optimal maternal and infant immunization strategies.",

Therefore, our objective was to determine pregnant women's perception of neonatal risks at varying GAs. Method  Through an anonymous 24-question survey, pregnant women were asked to designate the GA at delivery that is desirable, safe, and defined as full term. Responses were compared based on race, history of preterm birth, and medical comorbidities. Results  Among the 233 survey respondents, the majority (62.9%) desired delivery at 36 to 39 weeks' gestation. Black women were more likely to desire delivery at 28 to 35 weeks compared with other racial/ethnic groups ( p  = 0.005). Women with a history of preterm birth or medical complications were less likely to desire delivery at 40 weeks. More than 40% of respondents thought delivery at 8 months of pregnancy was safe and 40.3% responded that 37 weeks' gestation is considered term. Conclusion  Misconceptions surrounding the definition of a term pregnancy are pervasive and vary by race, obstetric history, and medical comorbidities. Our findings highlight the need for patient education about appropriate gestational length, especially in minority and high-risk populations.",

            "abstract":"INTRODUCTION: The role of perinatal diet in postpartum maternal mood disorders, including depression and anxiety, remains unclear. We investigated whether perinatal consumption of a Western-type diet (high in fat and branched-chain amino acids [BCAA]) and associated gestational weight gain (GWG) cause serotonin dysregulation in the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in postpartum depression and anxiety (PPD/A). METHODS: Mouse dams were fed one of four diets (high-fat/high BCAA, low-fat/high BCAA, high-fat, and low-fat) prior to mating and throughout gestation and lactation. Postpartum behavioral assessments were conducted, and plasma and brain tissues assayed. To evaluate potential clinical utility, we conducted preliminary human studies using data from an extant sample of 17 primiparous women with high GWG, comparing across self-reported postpartum mood symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) for percent GWG and plasma amino acid levels. RESULTS: Mouse dams fed the high-fat/high BCAA diet gained more weight per kcal consumed, and BCAA-supplemented dams lost weight more slowly postpartum. Dams on BCAA-supplemented diets exhibited increased PPD/A-like behavior, decreased dopaminergic function, and decreased plasma tyrosine and histidine levels when assessed on postnatal day (P)8. Preliminary human data showed that GWG accounted for 29% of the variance in EPDS scores. Histidine was also lower in women with higher EPDS scores. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the role of perinatal diet and excess GWG in the development of postpartum mood disorders.",

            "abstract":"Background: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common infectious cause of fetal malformations and childhood hearing loss. CMV is more common among socially disadvantaged groups, and it clusters geographically in poor communities. We conducted a geospatial analysis of chronic and primary CMV infection among pregnant women around Durham, NC. Methods: We performed a geospatial analysis of subjects from an ongoing study of CMV infection among pregnant women using geographic information systems and spatial statistics. Subjects were categorized on the basis of results of their CMV immunoglobulin G avidity testing as seronegative, seropositive, or primary infection. We used generalized additive models to analyze the spatial distributions of individuals who fell into each category and to control for confounders such as race and age. We used a generalized estimating equation to correlate community-level variables with CMV status. Results: Of 3527 pregnant women aged 15 to 59 years, 93.4% were either white or black. CMV seropositivity was significantly more common among non-Hispanic white subjects than among minority subjects (odds ratio, 3.76 [95% confidence interval, 3.25-4.34]). We identified a cluster in which women had elevated odds of CMV seropositivity in the urban neighborhoods of Durham. Cases of primary CMV infection were more common in areas with higher-than-average CMV seroprevalence. Neighborhood median family income was associated inversely with the prevalence of chronic CMV. Conclusions: We found a high prevalence of CMV seropositivity in urban low-income neighborhoods among pregnant women, particularly among racial and ethnic minorities. Seronegative pregnant women from these communities might be at heightened risk for primary CMV infection.",

            "abstract":"BACKGROUND: Oxytocin is a potent uterotonic agent that is widely used for induction and augmentation of labor. Oxytocin has a narrow therapeutic index and the optimal dosing for any individual woman varies widely. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether genetic variation in the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) or in the gene encoding G protein-coupled receptor kinase 6 (GRK6), which regulates desensitization of the oxytocin receptor, could explain variation in oxytocin dosing and labor outcomes among women being induced near term. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant women with a singleton gestation residing in Durham County, NC, were prospectively enrolled as part of the Healthy Pregnancy, Healthy Baby cohort study. Those women undergoing an induction of labor at 36 weeks or greater were genotyped for 18 haplotype-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms in OXTR and 7 haplotype-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms in GRK6 using TaqMan assays. Linear regression was used to examine the relationship between maternal genotype and maximal oxytocin infusion rate, total oxytocin dose received, and duration of labor. Logistic regression was used to test for the association of maternal genotype with mode of delivery. For each outcome, backward selection techniques were utilized to control for important confounding variables and additive genetic models were used. Race/ethnicity was included in all models because of differences in allele frequencies across populations, and Bonferroni correction for multiple testing was used. RESULTS: DNA was available from 482 women undergoing induction of labor at 36 weeks or greater. Eighteen haplotype-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms within OXTR and 7 haplotype-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms within GRK6 were examined. Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms in OXTR showed nominal significance with maximal infusion rate of oxytocin, and two single-nucleotide polymorphisms in OXTR were associated with total oxytocin dose received. One single-nucleotide polymorphism in OXTR and two single-nucleotide polymorphisms in GRK6 were associated with duration of labor, one of which met the multiple testing threshold (P = .0014, rs2731664 [GRK6], mean duration of labor, 17.7 hours vs 20.2 hours vs 23.5 hours for AA, AC, and CC genotypes, respectively). Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms, two in OXTR and one in GRK6, showed nominal significance with mode of delivery. CONCLUSION: Genetic variation in OXTR and GRK6 is associated with the amount of oxytocin required as well as the duration of labor and risk for cesarean delivery among women undergoing induction of labor near term. With further research, pharmacogenomic approaches may potentially be utilized to develop personalized treatment to improve safety and efficacy outcomes among women undergoing induction of labor.",

Objective  We compared surgical site occurrences (SSOs) in cesarean patients receiving closed-incision negative-pressure therapy (ciNPT) or standard-of-care (SOC) dressing. Study Design  A single-center randomized controlled trial compared ciNPT (5-7 days) to SOC dressing (1-2 days) in obese women (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 35), undergoing cesarean delivery between 2012 and 2014. Participants were randomized 1:1 and monitored 42 ± 10 days postoperatively. The primary outcome SSOs included unanticipated local inflammation, wound infection, seroma, hematoma, dehiscence, and need for surgical or antibiotic intervention. Results  Of the 92 randomized patients, 82 completed the study. ciNPT and SOC groups had similar baseline characteristics. Mean BMI was 46.5 ± 6.5 and no treatment-related serious adverse events. Compared with SOC, the ciNPT group had fewer SSOs (7/43 [16.3%] vs. 2/39 [5.1%], respectively; p  = 0.16); significantly fewer participants with less incisional pain both at rest (39/46 [84.8%] vs. 20/46 [43.5%]; p  < 0.001) and with incisional pressure (42/46 [91.3%] vs. 25/46 [54.3%]; p  < 0.001); and a 30% decrease in total opioid use (79.1 vs. 55.9 mg morphine equivalents, p  = 0.036). Conclusion  A trend in SSO reduction and a statistically significant reduction in postoperative pain and narcotic use was observed in women using ciNPT.",

Use in the first 48 hours after vaccination was 64%, primarily to prevent and/or treat fever and pain. Acetaminophen was administered 2.6 times more frequently than ibuprofen. Ibuprofen was used more in the 15-month compared with the 6-month-old children (28% vs 7.4%, respectively, P = .001). The majority of caregivers disagreed with their use for fever (53%) or pain (59%). Antipyretic analgesic use, including prophylaxis, around vaccinations was common in our study population. Effective interventions are needed to target parents/caregivers to eliminate unnecessary antipyretic analgesic use around vaccination time and foster nonmedication alternatives.",

            "abstract":"In 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) released a position paper on influenza vaccination recommending that pregnant women have the highest priority for seasonal vaccination in countries where the initiation or expansion of influenza immunization programs is under consideration. Although the primary goal of the WHO recommendation is to prevent influenza illness in pregnant women, the potential benefits of maternal immunization in protecting young infants are also recognized. The extent to which maternal influenza vaccination may prevent adverse birth outcomes such as preterm birth or small-for-gestational-age birth, however, is unclear as available studies are in disagreement. To inform WHO about the empirical evidence relating to possible benefits of influenza vaccination on birth outcomes, a consultation of experts was held in Montreal, Canada, September 30-October 1, 2015. Presentations and discussions covered a broad range of issues, including influenza virus infection during pregnancy and its effect on the health of the mother and the fetus, possible biological mechanisms for adverse birth outcomes following maternal influenza illness, evidence on birth outcomes following influenza illness during pregnancy, evidence from both observational studies and randomized controlled trials on birth outcomes following influenza vaccination of pregnant women, and methodological issues. This report provides an overview of the presentations, discussions and conclusions.",

            "abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether surgical procedures involving the uterine cervix were associated with pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth, low birth weight, cesarean delivery and pregnancy loss. DESIGN: Population-based observational study nested in retrospective matched cohort. SETTING: Kaiser Permanente Northwest integrated health plan in Oregon/Washington, U.S.A. POPULATION: Female health plan members age 14-53 years with documented pregnancies from 1998-2009. Women with prior excisional and ablative cervical surgical procedures (N = 322) were compared to women unexposed to cervical procedures (N = 4,307) and, separately, to those having undergone only diagnostic/biopsy procedures (N = 847). METHODS: Using log-linear regression models, we examined risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in relation to prior excisional or ablative cervical surgical procedures. We stratified excisional procedures by excision thickness. We evaluated for confounding by age, body mass index, race, smoking history, previous preterm birth, and parity. RESULTS: We found a positive association between excisional treatment > = 1.0 cm and the outcomes preterm birth and low birth weight (preterm birth unadjusted risk ratio [RR] = 2.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16-3.98 for excisions ≥1.0 cm compared to unexposed women), particularly in women who delivered within one year of surgery (RR = 3.26, 95% CI 1.41-7.53). There was no clear association between excisional treatment and cesarean delivery, and treated women did not have a substantially higher risk of dysfunctional labor. Ablative treatment was not associated with low birth weight, preterm birth, or cesarean delivery but was associated with pregnancy loss (RR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.05-1.93 vs. unexposed women). Analyses using the diagnostic procedures comparison group produced similar results. CONCLUSION: Women with > = 1.0 cm excisional treatment had elevated risk of preterm birth and low birth weight when compared to unexposed women and women with cervical diagnostic procedures. This suggests that increased risk derives from the treatment itself, not from other characteristics. The observed association between pregnancy loss and ablative surgical treatment requires further investigation.",

            "abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Although antifibrinolytic agents are used to prevent and treat hemorrhage, there are concerns about a potential increased risk for peripartum venous thromboembolism. We sought to determine the impact of tranexamic acid and ɛ-aminocaproic acid on in vitro clotting properties in pregnancy. METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from healthy pregnant, obese, and preeclamptic pregnant women (n = 10 in each group) prior to delivery as well as from healthy non-pregnant controls (n = 10). Maximum clot firmness (MCF) and clotting time (CT) were measured using rotation thromboelastometry in the presence of tranexamic acid (3, 30, or 300 μg/mL) or ɛ-aminocaproic acid (30, 300, or 3000 μg/mL). ANOVA and regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Mean whole blood MCF was significantly higher in healthy pregnant vs. non-pregnant women (66.5 vs. 57.5 mm, p < 0.001). Among healthy pregnant women, there was no significant difference between mean MCF (whole blood alone, and with increasing tranexamic acid doses = 66.5, 66.1, 66.4, 66.3 mm, respectively; p = 0.25) or mean CT (409, 412, 420, 424 sec; p = 0.30) after addition of tranexamic acid. Similar results were found using ɛ-aminocaproic acid. Preeclamptic women had a higher mean MCF after the addition of ɛ-aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid (p = 0.05 and p = 0.04, respectively) compared to whole blood alone. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state, as reflected by an increased MCF compared to non-pregnant women. Addition of antifibrinolytic therapy in vitro does not appear to increase MCF or CT for non-pregnant, pregnant, and obese women. Whether antifibrinolytics are safe in preeclampsia may require further study.",

            "abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Most pregnant women who quit smoking return to smoking postpartum. Trials to prevent this return have been unsuccessful. We tested the efficacy of a nurse-delivered intervention in maintaining smoking abstinence after delivery among pregnant women who quit smoking that was tailored on their high risk of relapse (eg, had strong intentions to return). METHODS: We recruited 382 English-speaking spontaneous pregnant quitters from 14 prenatal clinics and randomized them to receive either a smoking abstinence booklet plus newsletters about parenting and stress (control) or a nurse-delivered smoking abstinence intervention that differed in intensity for the high and low risk groups. Our primary outcome was smoking abstinence at 12 months postpartum. RESULTS: Using intent-to-treat analyses, there was a high rate of biochemically validated smoking abstinence at 12 months postpartum but no arm differences ( CONTROL: 36% [95% confidence interval [CI]: 29-43] vs. INTERVENTION: 35% [95% CI: 28-43], P = .81). Among women at low risk of returning to smoking, the crude abstinence rate was significantly higher in the control arm (46%) than in the intervention arm (33%); among women at high risk of returning to smoking, the crude abstinence rate was slightly lower but not different in the control arm (31%) than in the intervention arm (37%). CONCLUSIONS: Low-risk women fared better with a minimal intervention that focused on parenting skills and stress than when they received an intensive smoking abstinence intervention. The opposite was true for women who were at high risk of returning to smoking. Clinicians might need to tailor their approach based on whether women are at high or low risk of returning to smoking. IMPLICATIONS: Results suggest that high-risk and low-risk women might benefit from different types of smoking relapse interventions. Those who are lower risk of returning to smoking might benefit from stress reduction that is devoid of smoking content, whereas those who are higher risk might benefit from smoking relapse prevention.",

            "abstract":"BACKGROUND: Infants who are born at 34 to 36 weeks of gestation (late preterm) are at greater risk for adverse respiratory and other outcomes than those born at 37 weeks of gestation or later. It is not known whether betamethasone administered to women at risk for late preterm delivery decreases the risks of neonatal morbidities. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial involving women with a singleton pregnancy at 34 weeks 0 days to 36 weeks 5 days of gestation who were at high risk for delivery during the late preterm period (up to 36 weeks 6 days). The participants were assigned to receive two injections of betamethasone or matching placebo 24 hours apart. The primary outcome was a neonatal composite of treatment in the first 72 hours (the use of continuous positive airway pressure or high-flow nasal cannula for at least 2 hours, supplemental oxygen with a fraction of inspired oxygen of at least 0.30 for at least 4 hours, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or mechanical ventilation) or stillbirth or neonatal death within 72 hours after delivery. RESULTS: The primary outcome occurred in 165 of 1427 infants (11.6%) in the betamethasone group and 202 of 1400 (14.4%) in the placebo group (relative risk in the betamethasone group, 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 0.97; P=0.02). Severe respiratory complications, transient tachypnea of the newborn, surfactant use, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia also occurred significantly less frequently in the betamethasone group. There were no significant between-group differences in the incidence of chorioamnionitis or neonatal sepsis. Neonatal hypoglycemia was more common in the betamethasone group than in the placebo group (24.0% vs. 15.0%; relative risk, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.37 to 1.87; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Administration of betamethasone to women at risk for late preterm delivery significantly reduced the rate of neonatal respiratory complications.

            "abstract":"Oxytocin is a potent uterotonic agent and is used clinically for induction and augmentation of labor, as well as for prevention and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage. Oxytocin increases uterine contractility by activating the oxytocin receptor (OXTR), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family, which is prone to molecular desensitization. After oxytocin binding, the OXTR is phosphorylated by a member of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) family, which allows for recruitment of β-arrestin, receptor internalization, and desensitization. According to previous in vitro analyses, desensitization of calcium signaling by the OXTR is mediated by GRK6. The objective of this study was to determine the role of GRK6 in mediating uterine contractility. Here, we demonstrate that uterine GRK6 levels increase in pregnancy and using a telemetry device to measure changes in uterine contractility in live mice during labor, show that mice lacking GRK6 produce a phenotype of enhanced uterine contractility during both spontaneous and oxytocin-induced labor compared with wild-type or GRK5 knockout mice. In addition, the observed enhanced contractility was associated with high rates of term stillbirth. Lastly, using a heterologous in vitro model, we show that β-arrestin recruitment to the OXTR, which is necessary for homologous OXTR desensitization, is dependent on GRK6. Our findings suggest that GRK6-mediated OXTR desensitization in labor is necessary for normal uterine contractile patterns and optimal fetal outcome.",

            "abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We seek to characterize the effect of progesterone metabolites on spontaneous and oxytocin-induced uterine contractility. STUDY DESIGN: Spontaneous contractility was studied in mouse uterine horns after treatment with progesterone, 2α-hydroxyprogesterone, 6β-hydroxyprogesterone (6β-OHP), 16α-hydroxyprogesterone (16α-OHP), or 17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17-OHPC) at 10(-9) to 10(-6) mol/L. Uterine horns were exposed to progestins (10(-6) mol/L), followed by increasing concentrations of oxytocin (1-100 nmol/L) to study oxytocin-induced contractility. Contraction parameters were compared for each progestin and matched vehicle control using repeated measures 2-way analysis of variance. In vitro metabolism of progesterone by recombinant cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) microsomes (3A5, 3A5, and 3A7) identified major metabolites. RESULTS: Oxytocin-induced contractile frequency was decreased by 16α-OHP (P = .03) and increased by 6β-OHP (P = .05). Progesterone and 17-OHPC decreased oxytocin-induced contractile force (P = .02 and P = .04, respectively) and frequency (P = .02 and P = .03, respectively). Only progesterone decreased spontaneous contractile force (P = .02). Production of 16α-OHP and 6β-OHP metabolites were confirmed in all CYP3A isoforms tested. CONCLUSION: Progesterone metabolites produced by maternal or fetal CYP3A enzymes influence uterine contractility.",

            "abstract":"Background.  Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common cause of birth defects and hearing loss in infants and opportunistic infections in the immunocompromised. Previous studies have found higher CMV seroprevalence rates among minorities and among persons with lower socioeconomic status. No studies have investigated the geographic distribution of CMV and its relationship to age, race, and poverty in the community. Methods.  We identified patients from 6 North Carolina counties who were tested in the Duke University Health System for CMV immunoglobulin G. We performed spatial statistical analyses to analyze the distributions of seropositive and seronegative individuals. Results.  Of 1884 subjects, 90% were either white or African American. Cytomegalovirus seropositivity was significantly more common among African Americans (73% vs 42%; odds ratio, 3.31; 95% confidence interval, 2.7-4.1), and this disparity persisted across the life span. We identified clusters of high and low CMV odds, both of which were largely explained by race. Clusters of high CMV odds were found in communities with high proportions of African Americans. Conclusions.  Cytomegalovirus seropositivity is geographically clustered, and its distribution is strongly determined by a community's racial composition. African American communities have high prevalence rates of CMV infection, and there may be a disparate burden of CMV-associated morbidity in these communities.",

Pregnant women are at particularly high risk for morbidity and mortality related to several vaccine-preventable diseases. Furthermore, such illnesses are also associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as spontaneous abortion, congenital anomalies, preterm birth, and low birthweight. In addition to directly preventing maternal infection, vaccination during pregnancy may offer fetal and infant benefit through passive immunization. Several vaccines aimed at providing passive immunity to neonates are either currently recommended or in development. This article specifically addresses maternal benefits of maternal immunization following (1) vaccines recommended for all pregnant women; (2) vaccines recommended for pregnant women with particular risk factors; and (3) novel vaccines currently under development that primarily aim to at reduce infant morbidity and mortality.",

Multiple barriers to inclusion of these vulnerable populations in clinical trials have led to this paucity of data. However, federal legislation targeted at pediatric therapeutics, innovative clinical trial design, use of quantitative clinical pharmacology methods, pediatric thought leadership, and collaboration have successfully overcome many existing barriers. This success has resulted in improved knowledge on pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of therapeutics in children. To date, research in pregnant women has not been characterized by similar success. Wide gaps in knowledge remain despite the common use of therapeutics in pregnancy. Given the similar barriers to drug research and development in pediatric and pregnant populations, the route toward success in children may serve as a model for the advancement of drug development and appropriate drug administration in pregnant women.",

Case-patient 1 (26 years old, week 33 of gestation) received a diagnosis of RSV infection and required mechanical ventilation. Case-patient 2 (27 years old, week 34 of gestation) received a diagnosis of infection with influenza A(H1N1) virus and RSV and required mechanical ventilation. Case-patient 3 (21 years old, week 32 of gestation) received a diagnosis of group A streptococcus pharyngitis and RSV infection and was monitored as an outpatient.

            "abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Although many pregnant women quit smoking, most return to smoking postpartum. Returning to smoking is strongly related to women's stated intention about smoking during pregnancy. We examined factors related to women's intention to return to smoking to improve intervention trials. METHODS: We report cross-sectional baseline data from a randomized controlled trial to prevent postpartum return to smoking. Women (n = 382; 98% consent rate) were English-speaking women who smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetimes and at least 5 cigarettes a day prior to becoming pregnant. We fit logistic regression models to test whether women's intention to return to smoking was associated with demographic and smoking factors such as race, parity, and smoker self-identity. RESULTS: Forty-three percent of women had a strong intention of returning to smoking. Factors independently associated with intending to return to smoking were: stating they did not want to be currently pregnant (OR = 2.1, CI = 1.1-3.9), reporting being abstinent for fewer days (OR = 0.8, CI = 0.7-0.9), being less concerned about the harmful effects of smoking to themselves (OR = 1.6, CI = 0.9-2.8), viewing quit as temporary (OR = 2.1, CI = 1.2-3.6), and self-identifying selves as smokers (OR = 8.7, CI = 5.0-15.2). CONCLUSIONS: Although some factors related to intention to return to smoking were unchangeable, it might be possible to attempt to change women's attribution of why they quit to be more permanent and to have them change their self-identity to be a \"nonsmoker\" from a \"smoker who is not currently smoking.\" Helping women have stronger intentions to stay quit could promote less return to smoking postpartum.",

            "abstract":"BACKGROUND: Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) testing for fetal trisomy is highly effective among high-risk women. However, there have been few direct, well-powered studies comparing cfDNA testing with standard screening during the first trimester in routine prenatal populations. METHODS: In this prospective, multicenter, blinded study conducted at 35 international centers, we assigned pregnant women presenting for aneuploidy screening at 10 to 14 weeks of gestation to undergo both standard screening (with measurement of nuchal translucency and biochemical analytes) and cfDNA testing. Participants received the results of standard screening; the results of cfDNA testing were blinded. Determination of the birth outcome was based on diagnostic genetic testing or newborn examination. The primary outcome was the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) for trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome) with cfDNA testing versus standard screening. We also evaluated cfDNA testing and standard screening to assess the risk of trisomies 18 and 13. RESULTS: Of 18,955 women who were enrolled, results from 15,841 were available for analysis. The mean maternal age was 30.7 years, and the mean gestational age at testing was 12.5 weeks. The AUC for trisomy 21 was 0.999 for cfDNA testing and 0.958 for standard screening (P=0.001). Trisomy 21 was detected in 38 of 38 women (100%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 90.7 to 100) in the cfDNA-testing group, as compared with 30 of 38 women (78.9%; 95% CI, 62.7 to 90.4) in the standard-screening group (P=0.008). False positive rates were 0.06% (95% CI, 0.03 to 0.11) in the cfDNA group and 5.4% (95% CI, 5.1 to 5.8) in the standard-screening group (P<0.001). The positive predictive value for cfDNA testing was 80.9% (95% CI, 66.7 to 90.9), as compared with 3.4% (95% CI, 2.3 to 4.8) for standard screening (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this large, routine prenatal-screening population, cfDNA testing for trisomy 21 had higher sensitivity, a lower false positive rate, and higher positive predictive value than did standard screening with the measurement of nuchal translucency and biochemical analytes.

            "abstract":"BACKGROUND: Although many Latinos in the United States smoke, they receive assistance to quit less often than non-Latinos. To address this disparity, we recruited Latino couples into a randomized controlled trial and provided a smoking cessation program during a teachable moment, when men's partners were pregnant. METHODS: We compared two interventions: (i) written materials plus nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to (ii) materials, NRT, and couple-based counseling that addressed smoking cessation and couples communication. We recruited 348 expectant fathers who smoked via their pregnant partners from county health departments. Our primary outcome was 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence and was collected from November 2010 through April 2013 and analyzed in February 2014. RESULTS: We found high rates of cessation but no arm differences in smoking rates at the end of pregnancy (0.31 vs. 0.30, materials only vs. counseling, respectively) and 12 months after randomization (postpartum: 0.39 vs. 0.38). We found high quit rates among nondaily smokers but no arm differences (0.43 vs. 0.46 in pregnancy and 0.52 vs. 0.48 postpartum). Among daily smokers, we found lower quit rates with no arm differences but effects favoring the intervention arm (0.13 vs. 0.16 in pregnancy and 0.17 vs. 0.24 postpartum). CONCLUSIONS: A less intensive intervention promoted cessation equal to more intensive counseling. Postpartum might be a more powerful time to promote cessation among Latino men. IMPACT: Less intensive interventions when delivered during teachable moments for Latino men could result in a high smoking cessation rate and could reduce disparities.",

            "abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the nationwide prevalence of cystic fibrosis (CF) in pregnancy and determine what medical complications exist at delivery among pregnant women with CF. STUDY DESIGN: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) was queried for all delivery-related discharges. Women with CF were identified by International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modifications codes and compared with women without CF. The prevalence of selected severe medical complications was compared between the 2 groups (NIS years 2008-2010) using multivariable logistic regression and the linear change in prevalence of CF at delivery determined (NIS years 2000-2010). RESULTS: From 2000 to 2010, there was a significant linear increase in the prevalence of CF at delivery from 3.0 to 9.8 per 100,000 deliveries, in 2000 and 2010, respectively (R(2) = 0.92, P < .0001). From 2008-2010, there were 1119 deliveries to women with CF and 12,627,627 to women without CF. Women with CF were more likely to be white (P < .0001) and have diabetes (odds ratio [OR], 14.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 11.8-16.7) or asthma (OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 4.3-6.1). Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that women with CF were more likely to die (adjusted OR [aOR], 76.0; 95% CI, 31.6-183), require mechanical ventilation (aOR, 18.3; 95% CI, 10.8-31.2), or have pneumonia (aOR, 56.5; 95% CI, 43.2-74.1), acute renal failure (aOR, 17.3; 95% CI, 9.1-32.6), preterm labor (aOR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.9-2.6), or an adverse composite CF outcome (aOR, 28.1; 95% CI, 21.8-36.3). CONCLUSION: Pregnant women with CF are more likely to die, require mechanical ventilation, and have infectious complications compared with women without CF, although the absolute risks are low and these events are relatively rare.",

            "abstract":"In the United States, eradication and reduction of vaccine-preventable diseases through immunization has directly increased life expectancy by reducing mortality. Although immunization is a public priority, vaccine coverage among adult Americans is inadequate. The Institute of Medicine, the Community Preventive Services Task Force, and other public health entities have called for the development of innovative programs to incorporate adult vaccination into routine clinical practice. Obstetrician-gynecologists are well suited to serve as vaccinators of women in general and more specifically pregnant women. Pregnant women are at risk for vaccine-preventable disease-related morbidity and mortality and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, and low birth weight. In addition to providing direct maternal benefit, vaccination during pregnancy likely provides direct fetal and neonatal benefit through passive immunity (transplacental transfer of maternal vaccine-induced antibodies). This article reviews: 1) types of vaccines; 2) vaccines specifically recommended during pregnancy and postpartum; 3) vaccines recommended during pregnancy and postpartum based on risk factors and special circumstances; 4) vaccines currently under research and development for licensure for maternal-fetal immunization; and 5) barriers to maternal immunization and available patient and health care provider resources.",

DESIGN: Matched, retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Kaiser Permanente Northwest (KPNW), an integrated healthcare delivery system in Oregon and Washington. PATIENTS: Women 14 to 53 years old with KPNW enrollment during the period 1998 through 2009. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Pregnancy after exposure or index date. Pregnancy was defined using a validated algorithm and electronic medical records data. RESULTS: We observed 570 pregnancies following cervical treatment in 4,137 women, 1,533 pregnancies following a diagnostic procedure in 13,767 women, and 7,436 pregnancies in a frequency-matched sample of 81,435 women unexposed to treatment or diagnostic procedures. After adjusting for age and contraceptive use, we observed a higher rate of pregnancies in the treatment group compared to unexposed women (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.30-1.55), but no difference in pregnancy rates between the treatment and diagnostic procedure groups (HR = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.93-1.13). CONCLUSIONS: No adverse effects of cervical procedures on subsequent rates of pregnancy were observed in this cohort with up to twelve years of follow-up time.",

Yet, pregnant women remain underrepresented in clinical research. Through the lens of the socioecological model, we highlight reported barriers and facilitators to recruitment and retention of pregnant women in studies that sought their participation. We trace historical, policy-based reasons for the exclusion of pregnant women in clinical studies to present-day rationale for inclusion of this group. The findings highlight why it has been difficult to recruit and retain this population over time. A body of literature suggests that integrative sampling and recruitment methods that leverage the influence and reach of prenatal providers will overcome recruitment challenges. We argue that these strategies, in combination with building strong engagement with existing community-based organizations, will enable teams to more effectively promote and retain pregnant women in future longitudinal cohort studies.",

Thus, immunizing women during pregnancy with recommended vaccines provides direct maternal benefit. Furthermore, maternal immunization has the potential for both fetal and infant benefit by preventing adverse pregnancy outcomes and infection during early life through passive immunity. This article reviews current knowledge on the importance and benefits of maternal immunization, which are 3-fold: protecting the mother from antepartum infection; reducing poor pregnancy and fetal outcomes; and providing immunity for infants during the first few months of life.",

            "abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) puts women and children at risk of obesity. We piloted an SMS-texting intervention to promote healthy GWG among overweight and obese women. METHODS: We recruited 35 women and randomized them in a 2:1 fashion to: a tailored SMS-texting intervention (Preg CHAT) vs. a generic texting intervention (Txt4baby). Preg CHAT texts provided personalized feedback based on women's intake of sweetened beverages, fruits and vegetables, fast food, daily steps taken, and weight. We abstracted women's weights from charts and surveyed women at baseline and 32 weeks gestation. RESULTS: Few women refused the study; many (30%) did not complete the study, however. Of those in the Preg CHAT arm, 86% responded to texts, and 80% said they would recommend this program to a friend. For women who completed the surveys (n=23), those in the Preg CHAT arm had a mean gain of 6 less pounds than women in the Txt4Baby arm (95% CI -15.9, 4.0; p=0.24). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study shows feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of a low-intensity and disseminable intervention to help overweight and obese women reduce GWG. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: An SMS texting program might help overweight women reduce excessive GWG.",

Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) devices are the method of thromboprophylaxis in a nonpregnant population. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of IPC on markers of fibrinolysis during cesarean delivery. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a randomized controlled trial from April 2009 to March 2010 of women undergoing scheduled elective cesarean delivery. Forty-nine women were randomized to IPCs or usual care. All participants had three blood samples obtained: (1) baseline, (2) 1 hour after randomization, and (3) 30 minutes after cesarean delivery. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2) levels were analyzed in each sample using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Statistical analysis was performed using repeated measures two-way analysis of variance with α = 0.05. RESULTS: There was a time-dependent change in tPA, uPA, and PAI-1 levels following delivery but no difference in TAT and PAI-2 levels with time. There were no differences between women randomized to IPCs or usual care. CONCLUSION: Markers of fibrinolysis were not significantly altered by IPCs in this study of low-risk pregnant women. Further research regarding the mechanism and efficacy of IPCs in pregnant women is warranted.",

            "abstract":"The rising incidence of whooping cough, a highly contagious infection caused by Bordetella pertussis, is particularly significant for young infants who have the highest risk for morbidity and mortality. The pertussis resurgence has led to a shift in primary prevention relying on childhood vaccination to a cocooning strategy, that is, vaccination of close contacts of newborn infants (new mothers, fathers, grandparents, siblings, caretakers, etc.), thereby reducing pertussis exposure. Immunization of women during pregnancy rather than during the immediate postpartum period (the initial cocooning recommendation) appears to be a better approach by directly providing protection through transplacental transfer of maternal vaccine-induced antibodies. This article describes neonatal pertussis, cocooning as a means of reducing neonatal exposure to pertussis and maternal immunization as a means of protecting young infants against pertussis infection.",

A secondary objective was to identify any trends in provider inquiries over the study period. DESIGN: A retrospective descriptive study of pregnancy and lactation-related inquiries to the University of North Carolina Health Care System Drug Information Center database between January 2001 and December 2010. SETTING: University of North Carolina Health Care System Drug Information Center. INTERVENTION: Provider inquiries and responses were extracted and characterized by indication for treatment and reason for inquiry. Comparison of the first and second 5-year periods was performed to delineate trends. Descriptive statistics, Fisher's Exact and χ2 tests were used for analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Inquiry origin, time, and subject. RESULTS: 433 inquiries were retrieved over the study period from physicians (50%), pharmacists (21%), and nurses (18%). Inquiries were most often made during the antepartum period (34%), followed by the postpartum (28%) and preconception (22%) periods. The most frequent indications for inquiry were psychiatry (15%) and infectious diseases (14%), which remained constant throughout the study period. Safety was the most common reason for inquiry (52%). The responses provided to callers were limited due to lack of information availability 37% of the time. CONCLUSION: Psychiatry and infectious disease-related indications are the most frequent subjects of provider inquiry regarding medication use in pregnancy. Rates of inquiry remained constant throughout the past decade in most therapeutic areas. These findings are consistent with previous observations in other developed countries and suggest high-yield areas for pharmacist education.",

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Tdap immunization during pregnancy and its effect on infant responses to diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Phase 1-2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial conducted from 2008 to 2012. Forty-eight pregnant women aged 18 to 45 years received Tdap (n = 33) or placebo (n = 15) at 30 to 32 weeks' gestation, with crossover immunization postpartum. INTERVENTIONS: Tdap vaccination at 30 to 32 weeks' gestation or postpartum. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were maternal and infant adverse events, pertussis illness, and infant growth and development until age 13 months. Secondary outcomes were antibody concentrations in pregnant women before and 4 weeks after Tdap immunization or placebo, at delivery and 2 months' postpartum, and in infants at birth, at 2 months, and after the third and fourth doses of DTaP. RESULTS: No Tdap-associated serious adverse events occurred in women or infants. Injection site reactions after Tdap immunization were reported in 26 (78.8% [95% CI, 61.1%-91.0%]) and 12 (80% [95% CI, 51.9%-95.7%]) pregnant and postpartum women, respectively (P > .99). Systemic symptoms were reported in 12 (36.4% [ 95% CI, 20.4%-54.9%]) and 11 (73.3% [95% CI, 44.9%-92.2%]) pregnant and postpartum women, respectively (P = .03). Growth and development were similar in both infant groups. No cases of pertussis occurred. Significantly higher concentrations of pertussis antibodies were measured at delivery in women who received Tdap during pregnancy vs postpartum (eg, pertussis toxin antibodies: 51.0 EU/mL [95% CI, 37.1-70.1] and 9.1 EU/mL [95% CI, 4.6-17.8], respectively; P < .001) and in their infants at birth (68.8 EU/mL [95% CI, 52.1-90.8] and 14.0 EU/mL [95% CI, 7.3-26.9], respectively; P < .001) and at age 2 months (20.6 EU/mL [95% CI, 14.4-29.6] and 5.3 EU/mL [95% CI, 3.0-9.4], respectively; P < .001). Antibody responses in infants born to women receiving Tdap during pregnancy were not different following the fourth dose of DTaP. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This preliminary assessment did not find an increased risk of adverse events among women who received Tdap vaccine during pregnancy or their infants. For secondary outcomes, maternal immunization with Tdap resulted in high concentrations of pertussis antibodies in infants during the first 2 months of life and did not substantially alter infant responses to DTaP. Further research is needed to provide definitive evidence of the safety and efficacy of Tdap immunization during pregnancy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00707148.",

STUDY DESIGN: We enrolled infants in the intensive care nursery who were cooled for HIE and had available UCB in an open-label study of non-cyropreserved autologous volume- and red blood cell-reduced UCB cells (up to 4 doses adjusted for volume and red blood cell content, 1-5 × 10(7) cells/dose). We recorded UCB collection and cell infusion characteristics, and pre- and post-infusion vital signs. As exploratory analyses, we compared cell recipients' hospital outcomes (mortality, oral feeds at discharge) and 1-year survival with Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd edition scores ≥85 in 3 domains (cognitive, language, and motor development) with cooled infants who did not have available cells. RESULTS: Twenty-three infants were cooled and received cells. Median collection and infusion volumes were 36 and 4.3 mL. Vital signs including oxygen saturation were similar before and after infusions in the first 48 postnatal hours. Cell recipients and concurrent cooled infants had similar hospital outcomes. Thirteen of 18 (74%) cell recipients and 19 of 46 (41%) concurrent cooled infants with known 1-year outcomes survived with scores >85.

            "abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the acceptability of a Tdap vaccination program for partners of pregnant women. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant women and their partners were enrolled in a prospective acceptability study. For partners absent during the initial encounter, an introductory letter inviting the partner to participate was sent home. Tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) was offered to vaccine-eligible partners while vaccine-eligible pregnant women were offered Tdap immediately postpartum, as per national recommendations at the time the study was conducted. Tdap acceptance was defined as vaccination during study participation. RESULTS: A total of 69 pregnant women and 63 partners were enrolled. Excluding the 19 partners reporting prior receipt, 61.4% of partners (27/44) accepted Tdap during the study. Those who enrolled following the introductory letter were more likely to accept Tdap than those enrolled at the initial encounter (84 vs. 44%, p = 0.005). Excluding the 29 pregnant women reporting prior receipt, 65% (26/40) received Tdap postpartum. Demographic factors and vaccine beliefs were not associated with Tdap acceptance. CONCLUSION: Tdap vaccination for partners of pregnant women during prenatal care is acceptable. Large-scale implementation would require substantial interest and willingness of obstetrician-gynecologists to administer Tdap not only to pregnant women but also to their partners. Such a program would provide improved \"cocooning\" of vulnerable infants against pertussis.",

            "abstract":"Cadmium (Cd) is prevalent in the environment yet understudied as a developmental toxicant. Cd partially crosses the placental barrier from mother to fetus and is linked to detrimental effects in newborns. Here we examine the relationship between levels of Cd during pregnancy and 5-methylcytosine (5mC) levels in leukocyte DNA collected from 17 mother-newborn pairs. The methylation of cytosines is an epigenetic mechanism known to impact transcriptional signaling and influence health endpoints. A methylated cytosine-guanine (CpG) island recovery assay was used to assess over 4.6 million sites spanning 16,421 CpG islands. Exposure to Cd was classified for each mother-newborn pair according to maternal blood levels and compared with levels of cotinine. Subsets of genes were identified that showed altered DNA methylation levels in their promoter regions in fetal DNA associated with levels of Cd (n = 61), cotinine (n = 366), or both (n = 30). Likewise, in maternal DNA, differentially methylated genes were identified that were associated with Cd (n = 92) or cotinine (n = 134) levels. While the gene sets were largely distinct between maternal and fetal DNA, functional similarities at the biological pathway level were identified including an enrichment of genes that encode for proteins that control transcriptional regulation and apoptosis. Furthermore, conserved DNA motifs with sequence similarity to specific transcription factor binding sites were identified within the CpG islands of the gene sets. This study provides evidence for distinct patterns of DNA methylation or \"footprints\" in fetal and maternal DNA associated with exposure to Cd.",

            "abstract":"HIV-1 and CMV are important pathogens transmitted via breastfeeding. Furthermore, perinatal CMV transmission may impact growth and disease progression in HIV-exposed infants. Although maternal antiretroviral therapy reduces milk HIV-1 RNA load and postnatal transmission, its impact on milk CMV load is unclear. We examined the relationship between milk CMV and HIV-1 load (4-6 weeks postpartum) and the impact of antiretroviral treatment in 69 HIV-infected, lactating Malawian women and assessed the relationship between milk CMV load and postnatal growth in HIV-exposed, breastfed infants through six months of age. Despite an association between milk HIV-1 RNA and CMV DNA load (0.39 log(10) rise CMV load per log(10) rise HIV-1 RNA load, 95% CI 0.13-0.66), milk CMV load was similar in antiretroviral-treated and untreated women. Higher milk CMV load was associated with lower length-for-age (-0.53, 95% CI: -0.96, -0.10) and weight-for-age (-0.40, 95% CI: -0.67, -0.13) Z-score at six months in exposed, uninfected infants. As the impact of maternal antiretroviral therapy on the magnitude of postnatal CMV exposure may be limited, our findings of an inverse relationship between infant growth and milk CMV load highlight the importance of defining the role of perinatal CMV exposure on growth faltering of HIV-exposed infants.",

            "abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Smoking during pregnancy causes multiple perinatal complications; yet, the smoking rate among pregnant women has remained relatively stagnant. Most interventions to help pregnant smokers quit or reduce their smoking are not easily disseminable. Innovative and disseminable interventions are needed. METHODS: We recruited 31 pregnant smokers in their second trimester from prenatal clinics. We assessed feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an SMS text-based intervention in a 2-arm design. We compared SMS-delivered support messages to an intervention that provided support messages plus a scheduled gradual reduction (SGR) to help women reduce their smoking more than 3 weeks. We sent women in the SGR arm \"alert texts\" at times to instruct them to smoke. We asked women not to smoke unless they received an alert text. RESULTS: Most women (86%) reported reading most or all of the texts. Women in both arms rated the program as helpful (M = 6, SD = 1 vs. M = 5, SD = 2, SGR vs. support only, respectively). Women in the SGR arm had a higher rate of biochemically validated 7-day point prevalence at the end of pregnancy 13.4% versus 7.5%. Of those still smoking, women reduced their smoking substantially with more reduction in the SGR arm (SGR arm: M = 16, SD = 11 vs. support messages only: M = 12, SD = 7). CONCLUSIONS: We developed an easily disseminable intervention that could possibly promote cessation and reduction among pregnant women with SMS texting ability. Women in this pilot were enthusiastic about the program, particularly those in the SGR arm. This program needs further examination.",

A panel of experts was charged with developing guiding principles for the design of clinical trials and the assessment of safety of vaccines during pregnancy. Definitions and a grading system to evaluate local and systemic reactogenicity, adverse events, and other events associated with pregnancy and delivery were developed. The purpose of this report is to provide investigators interested in vaccine research in pregnancy with a basic set of tools to design and implement maternal immunization studies which may be conducted more efficiently using consistent definitions and grading of adverse events to allow the comparison of safety reports from different trials. These guidelines and safety assessment tools may be modified to meet the needs of each particular protocol based on evidence collected as investigators use them in clinical trials in different settings and share their findings and expertise.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this IRB-approved prospective, observational case series, 20 full-term Hispanic newborns had dilated retinal examinations and imaging by hand-held SD-OCT without sedation at the Duke Birthing Center. RESULTS: Of 20 newborns imaged (35% male; median gestational age: 39 weeks; range: 36 to 40 weeks), two (10%) had bilateral subfoveal fluid, including one case of bilateral double subretinal fluid pockets. Three eyes of two infants (10%) had retinal macular cystoid structures (one enlarged at 1.5 months, with resolution by 3 months). These SD-OCT findings were not visible by indirect ophthalmoscopy. CONCLUSION: Some Hispanic newborns have subretinal fluid or macular cystoid structures on SD-OCT. This study expands our understanding of findings seen by SD-OCT in healthy full-term newborns of various races.",

We report on the effects of romiplostim use throughout pregnancy. CASE: A 28-year-old primigravid woman with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura initiated a planned pregnancy on romiplostim. The second and third trimesters were marked by a cyclic pattern of thrombocytopenia requiring supplemental corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin and resultant thrombocytosis. Increased romiplostim doses and daily corticosteroids stabilized the platelet count before induction of labor at 33 weeks of gestation. The newborn manifested intraventricular hemorrhage at birth, although no developmental delay was present on follow-up at 10 months of age. CONCLUSION: The decreased efficacy of romiplostim monotherapy is attributed to increased target-mediated drug disposition and the physiologic changes of pregnancy. Safety concerns still exist for the developmental effects of romiplostim on the fetus.",

During that time, several new pediatric and adult vaccines were introduced including rotavirus, quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate, herpes zoster, human papillomavirus, pneumococcal conjugate, and adult tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis. Despite the impact of immunization and its public health priority, vaccine coverage among adults in the United States remains suboptimal. Incorporation of adult immunization into routine obstetric and gynecologic care may be one innovative approach to vaccinate women. Pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable period for VPD-associated complications for both mother and baby, as demonstrated by the influenza pandemic of 2009. In addition to preventing maternal and congenital disease, maternal immunization can also provide direct fetal/infant protection via passive immunity. This article summarizes vaccine classification, specific vaccines recommended during pregnancy/postpartum, and barriers to maternal immunization.",

            "abstract":"BACKGROUND: HIV-related outcomes may be affected by biological sex and by pregnancy. Including women in general and pregnant women in particular in HIV-related research is important for generalizability of findings. OBJECTIVE: To characterize representation of pregnant and non-pregnant women in HIV-related research conducted in general populations. DATA SOURCES: All HIV-related articles published in fifteen journals from January to March of 2011. We selected the top five journals by 2010 impact factor, in internal medicine, infectious diseases, and HIV/AIDS. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: HIV-related studies reporting original research on questions applicable to both men and women of reproductive age were considered; studies were excluded if they did not include individual-level patient data. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Articles were doubly reviewed and abstracted; discrepancies were resolved through consensus. We recorded proportion of female study participants, whether pregnant women were included or excluded, and other key factors. RESULTS: In total, 2014 articles were published during this period. After screening, 259 articles were included as original HIV-related research reporting individual-level data; of these, 226 were determined to be articles relevant to both men and women of reproductive age. In these articles, women were adequately represented within geographic region. The vast majority of published articles, 183/226 (81%), did not mention pregnancy (or related issues); still fewer included pregnant women (n=33), reported numbers of pregnant women (n=19), or analyzed using pregnancy status (n=9). LIMITATIONS: Data were missing for some key variables, including pregnancy. The time period over which published works were evaluated was relatively short. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: The under-reporting and inattention to pregnancy in the HIV literature may reduce policy-makers' ability to set evidence-based policy around HIV/AIDS care for pregnant women and women of child-bearing age.",

Maternal blood lead levels more likely result from lead remobilization from historic versus contemporaneous exposures.

            "abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cervical dilation at the time of physical examination indicated cerclage placement can predicts latency and gestational age at delivery. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of all women who underwent physical examination indicated cerclage placement from 1996 to 2011 at Duke University Hospital (DUH) was performed. Physical examination indicated cerclage was defined as cerclage placement after 16 weeks in women with a cervical length of less than 2.5 cm and/or cervical dilation greater than or equal to 1 cm at time of procedure. Subjects were divided into two groups depending on cervical dilation at time of procedure (2 cm, <2 cm) for comparison. A multivariate linear regression model for the outcome gestational age of delivery was constructed, controlling for confounding variables. RESULTS: A total of 110 women with complete data were available for analysis. Median gestational age at cerclage placement was similar between the two groups (20.3 vs. 20.3 weeks, p = 0.8). Women with cervical dilatation ≥ 2 cm dilation delivered at an earlier median gestational age than women with cervical dilation <2 cm (27.0 vs. 35.6 weeks, p < 0.001). Cervical dilation at the time of cerclage placement independently predicted gestational age at delivery while controlling for use of intracervical Foley balloon catheter for membrane reduction, cerclage suture type, history of prior preterm birth, race, insurance status, and tobacco use. CONCLUSIONS: Women who receive a rescue cerclage are more likely to deliver at an earlier gestational age when cervical dilation is ≥ 2 cm at the time of procedure.",

The ultimate goal of labor induction is to achieve vaginal delivery by stimulating uterine contractions before the spontaneous onset of labor. Labor induction is clearly indicated when the benefits outweigh the maternal and fetal risks of continued gestation, as well as potential risks associated with the procedure. Many women undergoing labor induction require cervical ripening--a method to facilitate softening, thinning, and dilation of an unfavorable cervix--because it reduces the time to delivery and incidence of failed induction. This article summarizes currently available methods for labor induction and cervical ripening, advantages and disadvantages of various methods, and the safety and effectiveness of each method based on well-conducted clinical trials.",

The outcomes include change from baseline in the child's diet, physical activity and weight, and in the mother's parenting behaviors, diet, physical activity, and weight. METHOD: The intervention targeted parenting through maternal emotion regulation, home environment, feeding practices, and modeling of healthy behaviors. 400 mother-child dyads were randomized. RESULTS: Mothers in the intervention arm, compared to the control arm, reduced instrumental feeding (-0.24 vs. 0.01, p<0.001) and TV snacks (-.069 vs. -0.24, p=0.001). There were also improvements in emotional feeding (p=0.03), mother's sugary beverage (p=0.03) and fruit/vegetable (p=0.04) intake, and dinners eaten in front of TV (p=0.01); these differences were not significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons. CONCLUSION: KAN-DO, designed to maximize the capacity of mothers as agents of change, improved several channels of maternal influence. There were no group differences in the primary outcomes, but differences were observed in the parenting and maternal outcomes and there were trends toward improvement in the preschoolers' diets. Long-term follow-up will address whether these short-term trends ultimately improve weight status.",

            "abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To determine if maternal serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels remain predictive of funisitis after completion of antibiotic administration in preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). METHODS: A secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study. Daily blood samples obtained from PPROM subjects were analyzed for IL-6 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Subjects (N = 39) delivered >7 days post admission and were divided into those with and without funisitis. Data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Maternal serum IL-6 levels obtained 24-48 hours and 48-72 hours before delivery are elevated in PPROM subjects with funisitis compared to those without funisitis (6.3 vs. 2.7 pg/ml, P < 0.03; 6.1 vs. 1.7 pg/ml, P < 0.02). Receiver operator characteristic curve revealed an IL-6 level of 1.98 pg/ml had sensitivity of 86.7%, specificity of 46.7%, positive predictive value of 61.9% and negative predictive value of 77.8%. CONCLUSION: This data suggests that maternal serum IL-6 levels continue to be predictive of PPROM subjects destined to develop funisitis after completion of antibiotics.",

            "abstract":"BACKGROUND: Studies examining the influence of maternal age and birth order on birthweight have not effectively disentangled the relative contributions of each factor to birthweight, especially as they may differ by race. METHODS: A population-based, cross-sectional study of North Carolina births from 1999 to 2003 was performed. Analysis was restricted to 510 288 singleton births from 28 to 42 weeks' gestation with no congenital anomalies. Multivariable linear regression was used to model maternal age and birth order on birthweight, adjusting for infant sex, education, marital status, tobacco use and race. RESULTS: Mean birthweight was lower for non-Hispanic black individuals (NHB, 3166 g) compared with non-Hispanic white individuals (NHW, 3409 g) and Hispanic individuals (3348 g). Controlling for covariates, birthweight increased with maternal age until the early 30s. Race-specific modelling showed that the upper extremes of maternal age had a significant depressive effect on birthweight for NHW and NHB (35+ years, p<0.001), but only age less than 25 years was a significant contributor to lower birthweights for Hispanic individuals, p<0.0001. Among all racial subgroups, birth order had a greater influence on birthweight than maternal age, with the largest incremental increase from first to second births. Among NHB, birth order accounted for a smaller increment in birthweight than for NHW and Hispanic women. CONCLUSION: Birth order exerts a greater influence on birthweight than maternal age, with signficantly different effects across racial subgroups.",

            "abstract":"BACKGROUND: The postpartum period may be critical for the development of midlife obesity. Identifying factors associated with postpartum weight change could aid in targeting women for healthy lifestyle interventions. METHODS: Data from Active Mothers Postpartum (AMP), a study of overweight and obese postpartum women (n=450), were analyzed to determine the effect of baseline characteristics, breastfeeding, diet, physical activity, and contraception on weight change from 6 weeks to 12, 18, and 24 months postpartum. The repeated measures mixed model was used to test the association of these effects with weight change. RESULTS: Although mean weight loss was modest (0.49 kg by 24 months), the range of weight change was striking (+21.5 kg to -24.5 kg, standard deviation [SD] 7.4). Controlling only for baseline weight, weight loss was associated with breastfeeding, hormonal contraception, lower junk food and greater healthy food intake, and greater physical activity. Only junk food intake and physical activity were significant after controlling for all other predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Eating less healthy foods and being less physically active put overweight and obese women at risk of gaining more weight after a pregnancy.",

            "abstract":"PURPOSE: To report retinal findings for healthy newborn infants imaged with handheld spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD OCT). DESIGN: Prospective, observational case series. METHODS: Thirty-nine full-term newborn infants underwent dilated retinal examinations by indirect ophthalmoscopy and retinal imaging by handheld SD OCT, without sedation, at the Duke Birthing Center. RESULTS: Of the 39 infants imaged, 44% (17/39) were male. Race and ethnicity composition was 56% white, 38% black, 3% Asian, and 3% Hispanic. Median gestational age was 39 weeks (range, 36 to 41 weeks). Six (15%) of the 39 infants had bilateral subfoveal fluid on SD OCT not seen by indirect ophthalmoscopy. Eight infants (21%) had retinal hemorrhages noted on dilated retinal examination, 1 of which had subretinal fluid on SD OCT. Subretinal fluid was noted on follow-up examination to have resolved on SD OCT 1 to 4 months later. Infants with bilateral subretinal fluid had an older gestational age compared with infants without subretinal fluid (median, 40.4 vs 39.1 weeks, respectively; P = .03) and were more likely to have had mothers with diabetes (2/6 vs 0/33, respectively; P = .02). Vaginal versus Caesarian section delivery was not significantly different between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Some healthy full-term infants have bilateral subfoveal fluid not obvious on dilated retinal examination. This fluid resolves within several months. The visual significance of this finding is unknown, but clinicians should be aware that it is common when evaluating newborn infants for retinal pathologic features using SD OCT.",

Despite a mean elapsed time since the prior loss of 27 (range, 7-47) months, half (7/15, 47%) of the combined groups had high levels of grief on the PGS. Multiple positive scores on psychometric tests were frequent: Sixty percent (9/15) had high scores on the PGS Active Grief subscale or on the IES. Forty percent (6/15) had a high score on the DDI, and 17% (3/15) on the GAD. IR scores significantly and negatively correlated with scores on the Despair subscale of the PGS. The results from this pilot study suggest that high levels of grief and PTS symptoms are significant problems for pregnant women who have suffered late loss of a wanted pregnancy.

            "abstract":"Maternal hypertension is a major contributor to adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth (PTB) and low birth weight (LBW). Although several studies have explored the relationship between maternal hypertension and fetal health, few have examined how the longitudinal trajectory of blood pressure, considered over the course of pregnancy, affects birth outcomes. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian growth mixture model to jointly examine the associations between longitudinal blood pressure measurements, PTB, and LBW. The model partitions women into distinct classes characterized by a mean arterial pressure (MAP) curve and joint probabilities of PTB and LBW. Each class contains a unique mixed effects model for MAP with class-specific regression coefficients and random effect covariances. To account for the strong correlation between PTB and LBW, we introduce a bivariate probit model within each class to capture residual within-class dependence between PTB and LBW. The model permits the association between PTB and LBW to vary by class, so that for some classes, PTB and LBW may be positively correlated, whereas for others, they may be uncorrelated or negatively correlated. We also allow maternal covariates to influence the class probabilities via a multinomial logit model. For posterior computation, we propose an efficient MCMC algorithm that combines full-conditional Gibbs and Metropolis steps. We apply our model to a sample of 1027 women enrolled in the Healthy Pregnancy, Healthy Baby Study, a prospective cohort study of host, social, and environmental contributors to disparities in pregnancy outcomes.",

METHODS: We conducted a clinical trial that enrolled 120 pregnant women in which participants were randomly assigned to receive an inactivated 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine containing either 25 μg or 49 μg of hemagglutinin (HA) in a 2-dose series with a 21-day period between administration of the first and second doses. RESULTS: Following the first vaccination, HA inhibition (HAI) titers of ≥1:40 were detected in 93% (95% confidence interval [CI], 82%-98%) of subjects who received the 25-μg dose and 97% (95% CI, 88%-100%) of subjects receiving the 49-μg dose. In cord blood samples, HAI titers of ≥1:40 were found in 87% (95% CI, 73%-96%) of samples from the 25-μg dose group and in 89% (95% CI, 76%-96%) from the 49-μg dose group. Microneutralization titers tended to be higher than HAI titers, but the patterns of response were similar. CONCLUSIONS: In pregnant women, 1 dose of an inactivated 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine containing 25 μg of HA elicited an antibody response typically associated with protection against influenza infection. Efficient transplacental transfer of antibody was also documented.",

The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was queried for all pregnancy-related discharges, pregnancy complications and viral hepatitis from 1995 to 2005. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between HBV, HCV, HBV + HCV and pregnancy-related complications including GDM, PTB, IUGR, pre-eclampsia, antepartum haemorrhage, cholestasis and caesarean delivery. Model covariates included maternal age, race, insurance status, substance use and medical complications including liver complication, hypertension, HIV, anaemia, thrombocytopenia and sexually transmitted infections. Of 297 664 pregnant women data available for analysis, 1446 had a coded diagnosis of HBV, HCV or both. High-risk behaviours, such as smoking, alcohol and substance use were higher in women with either HBV or HCV. Women with HBV had an increased risk for PTB (aOR 1.65, CI [1.3, 2.0]) but a decreased risk for caesarean delivery (aOR 0.686, CI [0.53, 0.88]). Individuals with HCV had an increased risk for GDM (aOR 1.6, CI [1.0, 2.6]). Individuals with both HBV and HCV co-infection had an increased risk for antepartum haemorrhage (aOR 2.82, CI [1.1, 7.2]). There was no association of viral hepatitis with IUGR or pre-eclampsia. Women with hepatitis have an increased risk for complications during pregnancy. Research to determine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of counselling patients about potential risks for adverse outcomes is warranted.",

            "abstract":"Racial disparity in pregnancy outcomes is one of the most striking and poorly understood inequalities in American health. Genetic variability may be an important host factor influencing disparate birth outcomes between non-Hispanic black (NHB) and non-Hispanic white (NHW) women. Race-specific allelic frequencies in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene suggest its potential as a gene involved in health disparities. The Healthy Pregnancy, Healthy Baby Study is a prospective cohort of pregnant women aimed at identifying genetic, social, and environmental contributors to disparities in pregnancy outcomes in Durham, NC. VDR haplotype tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped via Taqman assays for 615 women. Analysis of variance was used to examine the association between maternal genotype and infant birthweight. Eight of 38 SNPs examined showed nominal significance among NHB women, with one VDR SNP (rs7975232) surpassing the multiple testing significance threshold. rs7975232, an anonymous polymorphism, is part of a VDR gene haplotype associated with variation in mRNA stability. mRNA stability can affect the amount of protein produced, thus directly affecting vitamin D levels and calcium homeostasis. In contrast to NHBs, there was no association between any VDR SNP and birthweight for NHWs. Genetic factors contributing to disparities in birth outcomes are not expected to be explained entirely by variation in a single gene. Nevertheless, our results suggest that maternal VDR gene polymorphisms do influence birthweight with differential effects accruing across racial groups. Further research identifying the functionality of VDR gene polymorphisms in pregnant women will improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms influencing birthweight.",

Cost-effectiveness analysis with a dynamic model of the US population of pregnant women and infants who were <6 months incorporated seasonal variation in influenza incidence. Compared with no vaccination, seasonal influenza vaccination in pregnancy costs $70,089 per quality-adjusted life year. Most of the benefit for infants was limited to those whose mothers were vaccinated within the first 4 weeks of vaccine availability. Once all women who were pregnant at the time of vaccine availability were vaccinated, vaccination of newly pregnant women had benefits for mothers but not infants. Delay of vaccination beyond November reduced both effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. The greatest population benefit from seasonal influenza vaccination in pregnancy was realized if pregnant women were vaccinated as soon as possible after trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine became available. Efforts to increase vaccine rates should be concentrated early in the influenza season.",

METHODS: Pathologist blinded to bleeding status assessed placental pathology for funisitis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Funisitis. RESULTS: Women with bleeding per vaginam were more likely to have funisitis (67.4% versus 36%, P < 0.001) compared with those without bleeding. Logistic regression demonstrated that bleeding per vaginam predicted funisitis after controlling for gestational age at admission, latency period and gestational age at delivery.

            "abstract":"BACKGROUND: Prevention of childhood obesity is a public health priority. Parents influence a child's weight by modeling healthy behaviors, controlling food availability and activity opportunities, and appropriate feeding practices. Thus interventions should target education and behavioral change in the parent, and positive, mutually reinforcing behaviors within the family. METHODS: This paper presents the design, rationale and baseline characteristics of Kids and Adults Now! - Defeat Obesity (KAN-DO), a randomized controlled behavioral intervention trial targeting weight maintenance in children of healthy weight, and weight reduction in overweight children. 400 children aged 2-5 and their overweight or obese mothers in the Triangle and Triad regions of North Carolina are randomized equally to control or the KAN-DO intervention, consisting of mailed family kits encouraging healthy lifestyle change. Eight (monthly) kits are supported by motivational counseling calls and a single group session. Mothers are targeted during a hypothesized \"teachable moment\" for health behavior change (the birth of a new baby), and intervention content addresses: parenting skills ((e.g., emotional regulation, authoritative parenting), healthy eating, and physical activity. RESULTS: The 400 mother-child dyads randomized to trial are 75% white and 22% black; 19% have a household income of $30,000 or below. At baseline, 15% of children are overweight (85th-95th percentile for body mass index) and 9% are obese (≥ 95th percentile). CONCLUSION: This intervention addresses childhood obesity prevention by using a family-based, synergistic approach, targeting at-risk children and their mothers during key transitional periods, and enhancing maternal self-regulation and responsive parenting as a foundation for health behavior change.",

            "abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Societal pressures against smoking during pregnancy may lead to a reduction in disclosure of smoking status. The objective of this study was to compare prevalence of smoking at prenatal intake by self-report with anonymous biochemical validation. METHODS: Women receiving care at the Duke Obstetrics Clinic from February 2005 through January 2006 were eligible for evaluation. Self-reported smoking and urine samples were obtained anonymously at prenatal intake. The NicCheck™ I semi-quantitative dipstick was used to detect urinary nicotine, cotinine, and 3-hydroxycotinine. The difference, with 95% confidence interval, between the proportions of smokers by self-report and urine testing was calculated for (1) high-positive vs. low-positive and negative results combined and (2) any positive vs. negative results. RESULTS: Among 297 subjects, self-reported smoking was 18.2 vs. 14.8% for low-positive and negative results combined with an absolute difference of 3.4%, [-2.9%, 9.6%]. When comparing self-report with any positive result (43.1%), the absolute difference was 24.9%, [17.4%, 32.1%]. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that most pregnant women disclose their smoking and many nonsmokers may have significant second-hand exposure. Universal urinary cotinine screening of pregnant women could aid in appropriately counseling women about second-hand exposure as well as monitoring women at high risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes.",

In 2002, oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) were the most popular contraceptive method, used by 11.6 million women in the USA [1].

            "abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Pregnancy-related weight retention can contribute to obesity, and breastfeeding may facilitate postpartum weight loss. We investigated the effect of breastfeeding on long-term postpartum weight retention. METHODS: Using data from the North Carolina Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC; 1996-2004), weight retention was assessed in women aged 18 years or older who had more than one pregnancy available for analysis (n=32,920). Using multivariable linear regression, the relationship between duration of breastfeeding after the first pregnancy and change in pre-pregnancy weight from the first pregnancy to the second pregnancy was estimated, controlling for demographic and weight-related covariates. RESULTS: Mean time between pregnancies was 2.8 years (standard deviation (SD) 1.5), and mean weight retention from the first to the second pregnancy was 4.9kg (SD 8.7). In covariate-adjusted analyses, breastfeeding for 20 weeks or more resulted in 0.39kg (standard error (SE) 0.18) less weight retention at the beginning of the second pregnancy relative to no breastfeeding (p=0.025). CONCLUSION: In this large, racially diverse sample of low-income women, long-term weight retention was lower among those who breastfed for at least 20 weeks.",

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of 27,771 women with their first and second births in North Carolina's Pregnancy Nutrition Surveillance System database from 1996-2004. GWG was categorized as inadequate, appropriate, or excessive, according to 2009 Institute of Medicine guidelines. Covariate adjusted polytomous logistic regression was used to test the association between GWG category in the first and second pregnancy. RESULTS: Compared with women with appropriate GWG in their first pregnancy, women with excessive GWG in their first pregnancy had an odds ratio of 2.6 (95% confidence interval, 2.4-2.7) for excessive GWG in their second pregnancy. Women with inadequate GWG in their first pregnancy were similarly likely to repeat this category in their subsequent pregnancy. CONCLUSION: GWG category in a woman's first pregnancy is a significant predictor of GWG category in her subsequent pregnancy.",

            "abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To better understand disparities in pregnancy outcomes, we analyzed data from North Carolina to determine how the pattern of maternal hypertensive disorders differs among non-Hispanic white (NHW), non-Hispanic black (NHB), and Hispanic women across the range of maternal ages. In addition, we explored whether rates of poor birth outcomes, including low birthweight (LBW) and preterm birth (PTB), among hypertensive women differed by race. METHODS: We restricted our analyses to births occurring between 1994 and 2003, constructing six five-year maternal age categories: 15-19 years, 20-24 years, 25-29 years, 30-34 years, 35-39 years, and 40-44 years. We used logistic regression to determine the relative contribution of race and age to incidence of maternal hypertension. All analyses controlled for the standard covariates of maternal education, marital status, and tobacco use. To assess the impact of maternal hypertension on birth outcomes, we limited the dataset to women with any hypertensive disorder and used linear regression to determine how particular race-age combinations affected outcomes. We also used logistic regression to find out how particular race-age combinations affected the likelihood of LBW and PTB. RESULTS: The risk of hypertension differed by race, with NHB women exhibiting the highest risk and Hispanic women the lowest risk. Further, rates of hypertension increased with age. Among hypertensive women, pregnancy outcomes differed by race and age, with NHB women having the poorest outcomes (i.e., LBW and PTB) and age exhibiting a dose-response relationship in PTB and very PTB. CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of maternal hypertension and subsequent outcomes are important contributors to persistent disparities in pregnancy outcomes.",

We examine whether blood lead levels (BLLs) result from current versus historic exposures, among a cohort of pregnant women. Cumulative logit models were used to characterize the relationship between maternal risk factors and higher BLLs. Maternal blood lead levels more likely result from lead remobilization from historic versus contemporaneous exposures. Even if all lead sources were abated immediately, women and their fetuses would experience lead exposure for decades.

            "abstract":"BACKGROUND: Pregnancy is associated with weight gain and obesity. The aim of this study was to identify the effect of parity and other factors on motivation to change diet to lose weight in a cohort of overweight and obese postpartum women. STUDY DESIGN: Active Mothers Postpartum is a randomized, controlled trial aimed at postpartum weight reduction. At baseline, we measured motivation to change diet to lose weight among 491 overweight/obese postpartum women. Logistic regression was used to model the effect of parity on motivation to change diet at baseline while adjusting for potential confounders including age, race, education, body mass index category, and breastfeeding status. RESULTS: Approximately two thirds (68%) of participants were highly motivated to change their diet to lose weight. In the multivariable model, women with three or more children had 2.5 times the odds of high motivation compared with primigravid women, and women not breastfeeding had 1.6 times the odds of high motivation compared with any breastfeeding. CONCLUSION: Although risk for obesity is incurred starting with a woman's first pregnancy, women in this study were more motivated to change their diet to lose weight after their third pregnancy. Further research is needed to understand how to best capitalize on the high motivation in women with several children as well as how to improve motivation for primigravid women and women who are breastfeeding.",

Improvements in neonatal intensive care have decreased the rate of infant mortality after preterm birth, particularly for those born at the earliest gestational ages. However, the result is an increasing absolute number of preterm birth survivors who suffer from disabilities such as neurosensory, respiratory and cognitive impairments. Evidence is also accumulating demonstrating that these survivors may be at increased risk for mortality, even into later childhood, and that they may face challenges transitioning into adulthood, such as a decreased likelihood of reproduction. © 2009 Future Medicine Ltd.",

            "abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Postpartum depression (PPD) is a significant concern for new mothers and their infants, as well as the health professionals who care for them. Obesity may be a risk factor for depression, and therefore, for PPD specifically. We examined the occurrence and risk factors for PPD in a sample of overweight and obese new mothers. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 491 women who were overweight or obese prior to pregnancy completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) 6 weeks postpartum, along with a number of other health- and pregnancy-related measures. Occurrence of depression was investigated, as well as bivariate and multivariate relationships between depression and demographic and health-related characteristics. RESULTS: As determined by an EPDS score of 13 or higher, the prevalence of PPD was 9.2%. Three items on the scale stood out as drivers of the total score (\"blame myself unnecessarily\", \"anxious or worried,\" \"feel overwhelmed\"). Bivariate correlates of depression included education, income, marital status, and self-reported chronic illness; income remained significant in the multivariate logistic regression model. BMI was not related to postpartum depression. DISCUSSION: In this group of overweight and obese women, there was no association between BMI group and postpartum depression.",

STUDY DESIGN: We performed a secondary analysis of data from Active Mothers Postpartum (AMP), a randomized controlled trial aimed at postpartum weight reduction. We assessed contraceptive use among 361 overweight/obese women 12 months postpartum. Logistic regression was used to model the effect of body mass index (BMI) categories on effective contraceptive use (intrauterine, hormonal or sterilization methods) while adjusting for potential confounders including age, race, parity, breastfeeding, education and chronic illness. RESULTS: Effective contraceptive use was reported by 45% of women. In the multivariable model, women with a BMI >or=35 kg/m(2) were less likely to use effective contraception than women with a BMI <30 kg/m(2) (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.8). There was a trend towards less use of effective contraception among women with a BMI 30-34.9 kg/m(2) as compared to women with a BMI <30 kg/m(2). CONCLUSION: At 12 months postpartum, obese women were less likely to use effective contraceptive methods than overweight women. Although certain contraceptive methods may be preferred over others in this population, providers should reinforce the importance of effective contraception to avoid unintended pregnancies in obese women.",

STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective review of all medical records for participants in the Baby Steps Trial. Data that were abstracted from 157 records were combined with baseline characteristics for logistic regression modeling of serious adverse events and adjusted for covariates. RESULTS: Serious adverse events occurred in 17% (9/52 pregnancies) and 31% (33/105 pregnancies) of participants in the control and NRT arms, respectively. Black race, adverse pregnancy history, and use of analgesic medication during pregnancy were significant predictors (P = .02, .04, and .01, respectively). Remaining covariates, which included randomization to NRT, were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Although race, poor pregnancy history, and use of analgesics were associated with serious adverse events, randomization to NRT during pregnancy was not a significant factor. Further research is needed to examine the safety of analgesic medications during pregnancy.",

PURPOSE: The primary objective of Active Mothers Postpartum was to promote a reduction in BMI through 24-months postpartum via sustainable lifestyle changes. DESIGN: Behavioral intervention RCT to enhance postpartum weight loss. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: A total of 450 overweight or obese women, enrolled 6-weeks postpartum, were recruited through obstetrics clinics and community posters in the Durham NC area. INTERVENTION: Intervention participants were offered eight healthy-eating classes, ten physical-activity classes, and six telephone-counseling sessions over 9 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes from baseline (6-weeks postpartum) to 1-month post-intervention (12-months postpartum) in: (1) diet (caloric intake, calories from fat, intake of certain foods); (2) physical activity (self-reported physical activity, television time); and (3) weight (collected 2004-2007, analyzed 2007-2008). RESULTS: Mean weight loss was 0.90 kg (+/-5.1 kg) in the intervention group and 0.36 kg (+/-4.9 kg) in the control group; this difference was not significant. There were also no significant group differences in improvement of diet or increased physical activity. In secondary analyses, there was a positive bivariate relationship between classes attended and weight loss (p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences among the arms in diet, physical activity, or weight change. Home-based interventions via mail, telephone, or Internet/e-mail may be more feasible and successful in this population. The postpartum period is an important phase in women's lives with regard to weight retention, but engaging them during this busy period remains a challenge. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00212251.",

METHOD: The analysis included only women who received NRT for whom we had complete data (N = 104). Data came from daily calendars created from recordings of counseling sessions and from telephone surveys at baseline and 38 weeks gestation. RESULTS: Overall, 29% of the 104 women used NRT for the recommended 6 weeks and 41% used NRT as directed in the first 48 hr after a quit attempt. Ordinal logistic regression modeling indicated that using NRT as directed in the first 48 hr and having made a previous quit attempt were the strongest predictors of longer NRT use. Univariate analyses suggested that primigravid women and women who used NRT longer were more likely to report quitting at 38 weeks gestation. DISCUSSION: Findings indicated that adherence to NRT is low among pregnant smokers, but adherence was a predictor of cessation. Future trials should emphasize adherence, particularly more days on NRT, to promote cessation during pregnancy.",

            "abstract":"BACKGROUND: Pregnancy and the postpartum period have been suggested as important contributors to overweight and obesity among women. This paper presents the design, rationale, and baseline participant characteristics of a randomized controlled intervention trial to enhance weight loss in postpartum women who entered pregnancy overweight or obese. METHODS: Active Mothers Postpartum (AMP) is based on the rationale that the birth of a child can be a teachable moment. AMP's primary objectives are to promote and sustain a reduction in body mass index (BMI) up to 2 years postpartum via changes in diet and exercise behavior, with a secondary aim to assess racial differences in these outcomes. Women in the intervention arm participate in ten physical activity group sessions, eight healthy eating classes, and six telephone counseling sessions over a 9-month period. They also receive motivational tools, including a workbook with recipes and exercises, a pedometer, and a sport stroller. RESULTS: Four hundred fifty women aged > or =18 (mean 30.9), with a BMI > or = 25 kg/m(2) (mean 33.0) at baseline (6 weeks postpartum) were enrolled; 45% of the final sample are black and 53% are white. Baseline characteristics by study arm and by race are presented. CONCLUSIONS: Our intervention is designed to be disseminated broadly to benefit the public health. Behavior change interventions based on principles of social cognitive theory, stage of readiness, and other models that coincide with a teachable moment, such as the birth of a child, could be important motivators for postpartum weight loss.",

            "abstract":"OBJECTIVES: We reviewed the evidence regarding the outcomes of interventions used in ovulation induction, superovulation, and in vitro fertilization (IVF) for the treatment of infertility. Short-term outcomes included pregnancy, live birth, multiple gestation, and complications. Long-term outcomes included pregnancy and post-pregnancy complications for both mothers and infants. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and Cochrane Collaboration resources. REVIEW METHODS: We included studies published in English from January 2000 through January 2008. For short-term outcomes, we excluded non-randomized studies and studies where a pregnancy or live birth rate per subject could not be calculated. For long-term outcomes, we excluded studies with fewer than 100 subjects and those without a control group. Articles were abstracted for relevant details, and relative risks or odds ratios, with 95 percent confidence intervals, were calculated for outcomes of interest for each study. RESULTS: We identified 5294 abstracts and (for the three questions discussed in this draft report) reviewed 1210 full-text articles and included 478 articles for abstraction. Approximately 80 percent of the included studies were performed outside the United States. The majority of randomized trials were not designed to detect differences in pregnancy and live birth rates; reporting of delivery rates and obstetric outcomes was unusual. Most did not have sufficient power to detect clinically meaningful differences in live birth rates, and had still lower power to detect differences in less frequent outcomes such as multiple births and complications. Interventions for which there was sufficient evidence to demonstrate improved pregnancy or live birth rates included: (a) administration of clomiphene citrate in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome, (b) metformin plus clomiphene in women who fail to respond to clomiphene alone; (c) ultrasound-guided embryo transfer, and transfer on day 5 post-fertilization, in couples with a good prognosis; and (d) assisted hatching in couples with previous IVF failure. There was insufficient evidence regarding other interventions. Infertility itself is associated with most of the adverse longer-term outcomes. Consistently, infants born after infertility treatments are at risk for complications associated with abnormal implantation or placentation; the degree to which this is due to the underlying infertility, treatment, or both is unclear. Infertility, but not infertility treatment, is associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the large emotional and economic burden resulting from infertility, there is relatively little high-quality evidence to support the choice of specific interventions. Removing barriers to conducting appropriately designed studies should be a major policy goal.",

            "abstract":"CONTEXT: Preterm birth is a major cause of infant morbidity and mortality. Less is known about long-term health among persons born preterm. OBJECTIVE: To determine the long-term effects of preterm birth on survival, reproduction, and next-generation preterm birth. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based, observational, longitudinal study using registry data from 1,167,506 singleton births in the Medical Birth Registry of Norway in 1967-1988. The cohort was followed up through 2002 for survival. The cohort was truncated to births from 1967-1976 for assessment of educational achievement and reproductive outcomes through 2004. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In relation to sex and gestational age at birth, absolute mortality, risk of fetal, infant, child, and adolescent mortality, and incidence and risk of reproduction and next-generation preterm birth. Singleton term (37-42 weeks) fetal deaths and live births, stratified by sex, served as the reference group for all analyses. RESULTS: The percentage who were born preterm was higher among boys (5.6%) than among girls (4.7%). Preterm participants had an increased risk of mortality throughout childhood. For boys born at 22 to 27 weeks, mortality rates were 1.33% and 1.01% for early and late childhood death, with relative risks (RRs) of 5.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-14.2) and 7.0 (95% CI, 2.3-22.0), respectively. The mortality rate for girls born at 22 to 27 weeks was 1.71% for early childhood death, with an RR of 9.7 (95% CI, 4.0-23.7); there were no late childhood deaths. For 28 to 32 weeks, the early and late childhood mortality rates among boys were 0.73% and 0.37%, with RRs of 2.5 (95% CI, 1.6-3.7) and 2.3 (95% CI, 1.3-4.1), respectively. Girls born at 28 to 32 weeks did not have a significantly increased risk of childhood mortality. Reproduction was diminished for index participants born preterm. For men and women born at 22 to 27 weeks, absolute reproduction was 29.3[corrected]% and 51.9[corrected]%, with RRs of 0.59 [corrected] (95% CI, 0.45[corrected]-0.79[corrected]) and 0.78 [corrected] (95% CI, 0.65[corrected]-0.93[corrected]), respectively. For 28 to 32 weeks, absolute reproduction was 43.1[corrected]% and 63.6[corrected]% for men and women, with RRs of 0.81[corrected] (95% CI, 0.77[corrected]-0.86[corrected]) and 0.89 [corrected] (95% CI, 0.86 [corrected]-0.93 [corrected]), respectively. Preterm women but not men were at increased risk of having preterm offspring. CONCLUSION: In persons born in Norway in 1967-1988, preterm birth was associated with diminished long-term survival and reproduction.",

Aversions first appeared during the first trimester of pregnancy. Women who experienced olfactory aversions were more likely also to experience gustatory aversions. Olfactory aversions were associated with women smoking less. Aversions to tobacco smoke are common among pregnant smokers, are associated with women smoking less, and could help explain pregnant women's smoking patterns.",

A retrospective review of medical records of PPROM subjects enrolled in a prospective cohort study was performed. Similar criteria to those established in a randomized trial for home management of PPROM by Carlan et al were applied. Assuming local residence, 65 subjects met the criteria for outpatient management. Demographic and delivery information were collected. Of the 65 subjects, 12 (18%) delivered <2 hours from the sentinel event. Adverse outcomes in these 12 subjects could have been devastating had they been managed as outpatients. Given the susceptibility of these subjects to obstetric emergencies, patients with PPROM at a viable gestational age should be considered for management as inpatients in a tertiary-care facility.",

            "abstract":"BACKGROUND: This study examines whether adding nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for pregnant smokers increases rates of smoking cessation. METHODS: An open-label randomized trial (Baby Steps, n=181) of CBT-only versus CBT+NRT (choice of patch, gum, or lozenge; 1:2 randomization) was used. Data were collected from 2003 through 2005; analyses were conducted in 2006 and 2007. Outcomes were biochemically validated self-reported smoking status at 7 weeks post-randomization, 38 weeks gestation, and 3 months postpartum. RESULTS: Women in the CBT+NRT arm were almost three times more likely than women in the CBT-only arm to have biochemically validated cessation at both pregnancy time points (after 7 weeks: 24% vs 8%, p=0.02; at 38 weeks gestation: 18% vs 7%, p=0.04), but not at 3 months postpartum (20% vs 14%, p=0.55). Recruitment was suspended early by an Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board when an interim analysis found a higher rate of negative birth outcomes in the CBT+NRT arm than in the CBT-only arm. In the final analysis, the difference between the arms in rate of negative birth outcomes was 0.09 (p=0.26), when adjusted for previous history of preterm birth. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of NRT to CBT promoted smoking cessation in pregnant women. This effect did not persist postpartum. More data are needed to determine safety parameters and to confirm the efficacy of NRT use during pregnancy.",

An abnormality of the foetal heart rate, auscultated at a routine antenatal visit, prompted an investigation that led to an ultrasound examination and detection of an intracranial haemorrhage and low amniotic fluid volume. An intrauterine foetal demise was averted. The clinical scenario in this case raises the issue of how often a stillbirth with intracranial haemorrhage may result from unrecognized factor deficiency.",

            "abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To estimate whether maternal serum interleukin (IL)-6 or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) obtained daily are elevated in women with preterm premature rupture of membranes who develop funisitis. METHODS: Daily blood samples were obtained from women with preterm premature rupture of membranes and analyzed for IL-6 and G-CSF by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Funisitis was determined by placental examination. Observations were stratified based on the presence or absence of funisitis and analyzed. Proportional hazards models were used to evaluate time-to-delivery on the basis of diagnostic IL-6 and G-CSF levels, determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: Of the 107 patients available for analysis, 54 (50%) had evidence of funisitis after delivery. Patients with funisitis were more likely to deliver at an earlier gestational age (28.5 weeks compared with 31.5 weeks, P<.001) and have Medicaid insurance (57% compared with 39%, P=.04). Serum IL-6 and G-CSF were elevated 24 to 48 hours before delivery in women with preterm premature rupture of membranes with funisitis compared with those without funisitis (IL-6, 7.5 compared with 2.8 pg/mL, P<.001; G-CSF, 121.7 compared with 56.9 pg/mL, P=.002). Using values identified by the receiver operating characteristic curve, elevated serum IL-6 in the interval 24-72 hours before delivery was significantly associated with funisitis (P<.03), even after controlling for gestational age and insurance status. CONCLUSION: Maternal serum IL-6 and G-CSF appear to be biomarkers in the identification of women with preterm premature rupture of membranes likely to develop funisitis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.",

STUDY DESIGN: A case-control study was performed. Cases (n = 95) delivered before 37 weeks after preterm labor (PTL) or preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) and controls (n = 105) delivered after 37 weeks. Maternal DNA was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction for a length polymorphism in intron 2 of the IL-1RN gene. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in maternal age, ethnicity, insurance status, or parity between groups. Allele and genotype frequencies did not differ significantly from that expected under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P = .59) in the total group as well as study groups. Of the 95 cases, 26.8% had at least 1 copy of allele 2 present compared with 12.4% in the control group (P < .0004). CONCLUSION: Maternal carriage of at least 1 copy of the IL-1RN allele 2 appears to be associated with increased risk of preterm birth.",

One major step is to examine the potential effectiveness of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). The potential benefits of providing pregnant women with NRT to help them quit smoking are still unknown; early interventions to test the effectiveness and efficacy are vital to advancing the field. This paper describes recruitment efforts for a multiclinic trial to test the effectiveness of NRT use in addition to behavioral therapy in promoting cessation during pregnancy. The biggest challenge is recruiting sufficient numbers of pregnant women. This paper discusses specific obstacles for recruitment and solutions. Knowing the potential pitfalls to recruiting pregnant women into these trials can lead to better studies and thus improved outcomes.",

            "abstract":"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence, mortality, and risk factors for pregnancy-related acute myocardial infarction in the United States. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample for the years 2000 to 2002 was queried for all pregnancy-related discharges. A total of 859 discharges included a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, for a rate of 6.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.0 to 9.4) per 100,000 deliveries. Among these, there were 44 deaths, for a case fatality rate of 5.1%. The odds of acute myocardial infarction were 30-fold higher for women aged 40 years and older than for women <20 years of age. Single independent variables that were statistically and clinically significant, including age, race, and certain medical conditions and obstetric complications, were entered into a multivariable logistic regression model. Hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 21.7, 95% CI 6.8 to 69.1), thrombophilia (OR 25.6, 95% CI 9.2 to 71.2), diabetes mellitus (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.5 to 8.3), smoking (OR 8.4, 95% CI 5.4 to 12.9), transfusion (OR 5.1, 95% CI 2.0 to 12.7), postpartum infection (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.2 to 10.1), and age 30 years and older remained as significant risk factors for pregnancy-related acute myocardial infarction. Black race was eliminated as a risk factor in the multivariable analysis, which suggests that the increased incidence among black women is explained by an increased prevalence of other cardiovascular risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Although acute myocardial infarction is a rare event in women of reproductive age, pregnancy increases the risk 3- to 4-fold. Certain medical conditions and complications of pregnancy increase the risk further and are potentially modifiable risk factors.",

            "abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To determine if fetal fibronectin can be used in a clinical setting to predict preterm birth and guide clinical management. STUDY DESIGN: We implemented a clinical protocol using the rapid fetal fibronectin test for patients presenting with symptoms of preterm labor. Adherence to the clinical pathway was at the discretion of the practitioner. Subjects who met the inclusion criteria (n = 404) were divided into 2 groups based on the fetal fibronectin result. Outcomes included time until delivery, gestational age at delivery and use of therapeutic interventions. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed. RESULTS: The 46 subjects (11.4%) with positive fetal fibronectin were more likely to deliver within 7 days, within 14 days, prior to 32 weeks' gestation and prior to 37 weeks' gestation (RR 22.0, 22.0, 12.3 and 5.1, respectively). For delivery within 7 days, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 67%, 92%, 30% and 98%, respectively. Time until delivery and gestational age at delivery were lower in women with a positive test, while the frequency of therapeutic interventions was higher (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: A positive fetal fibronectin test is predictive of preterm birth in a clinical setting. A negative fetal fibronectin test can be used to avoid unnecessary, potentially harmful interventions.",

Their greatest needs were for a \"guidance from a higher power\" and for \"someone to pray for them.\" Unlike other reported groups of patients, they did not want or expect their healthcare team to discuss their faith, or to pray with them. Most would prefer support from their own pastors, but their religious community was involved to only a small extent. They would welcome support from hospital chaplains, who could play a substantive and unique pastoral role in this clinical context.",

            "description":"<p>Primary Theme: Global Health</p><p>Vaccinations administered during pregnancy and the first year of a child&rsquo;s life are crucial for preventing a myriad of potentially deadly and debilitating infections such as polio, pertussis, measles, influenza and tetanus. Despite overwhelming scientific evidence on the benefits of vaccinations, pregnant women and parents of young children often refuse to accept, or choose to space out, vaccinations for themselves or their children. This phenomenon, termed vaccine hesitancy, is blamed for several vaccine-preventable outbreaks in the U.S., including the 2017 measles outbreak in a Somali community in Minnesota. In order to design effective behavior change interventions to mitigate vaccine hesitancy, we need to understand the role of misinformation in the development or promotion of vaccine hesitancy, as well as the subsequent decision to accept vaccines without delay.</p>",
