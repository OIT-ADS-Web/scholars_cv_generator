        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Target delineation in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) often proves challenging because of the notoriously narrow therapeutic margin. High doses are needed to achieve optimal levels of tumour control, and dosimetric inadequacy remains one of the most important independent factors affecting treatment outcome. METHOD: A review of the available literature addressing the natural behaviour of NPC and correlation between clinical and pathological aspects of the disease was conducted. Existing international guidelines as well as published protocols specified by clinical trials on contouring of clinical target volumes (CTV) were compared. This information was then summarized into a preliminary draft guideline which was then circulated to international experts in the field for exchange of opinions and subsequent voting on areas with the greatest controversies. RESULTS: Common areas of uncertainty and variation in practices among experts experienced in radiation therapy for NPC were elucidated. Iterative revisions were made based on extensive discussion and final voting on controversial areas by the expert panel, to formulate the recommendations on contouring of CTV based on optimal geometric expansion and anatomical editing for those structures with substantial risk of microscopic infiltration. CONCLUSION: Through this comprehensive review of available evidence and best practices at major institutions, as well as interactive exchange of vast experience by international experts, this set of consensus guidelines has been developed to provide a practical reference for appropriate contouring to ensure optimal target coverage. However, the final decision on the treatment volumes should be based on full consideration of individual patients' factors and facilities of an individual centre (including the quality of imaging methods and the precision of treatment delivery).",

Here we analyse 438 SNPs in this region in 46,451 BC and 15,438 OC cases, 15,252 BRCA1 mutation carriers and 73,444 controls and identify 13 candidate causal SNPs associated with serous OC (P=9.2 × 10(-20)), ER-negative BC (P=1.1 × 10(-13)), BRCA1-associated BC (P=7.7 × 10(-16)) and triple negative BC (P-diff=2 × 10(-5)). Genotype-gene expression associations are identified for candidate target genes ANKLE1 (P=2 × 10(-3)) and ABHD8 (P<2 × 10(-3)). Chromosome conformation capture identifies interactions between four candidate SNPs and ABHD8, and luciferase assays indicate six risk alleles increased transactivation of the ADHD8 promoter. Targeted deletion of a region containing risk SNP rs56069439 in a putative enhancer induces ANKLE1 downregulation; and mRNA stability assays indicate functional effects for an ANKLE1 3'-UTR SNP. Altogether, these data suggest that multiple SNPs at 19p13 regulate ABHD8 and perhaps ANKLE1 expression, and indicate common mechanisms underlying breast and ovarian cancer risk.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To determine whether daily chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) bathing of intensive care unit (ICU) patients leads to a decrease in hospital-acquired infections (HAIs), particularly infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). DESIGN Interrupted time series analysis. SETTING The study included 33 community hospitals participating in the Duke Infection Control Outreach Network from January 2008 through December 2013. PARTICIPANTS All ICU patients at study hospitals during the study period. METHODS Of the 33 hospitals, 17 hospitals implemented CHG bathing during the study period, and 16 hospitals that did not perform CHG bathing served as controls. Primary pre-specified outcomes included ICU central-line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), primary bloodstream infections (BSI), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs). MRSA and VRE HAIs were also evaluated. RESULTS Chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) bathing was associated with a significant downward trend in incidence rates of ICU CLABSI (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93-0.99), ICU primary BSI (IRR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94-0.99), VRE CLABSIs (IRR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.97-0.98), and all combined VRE infections (IRR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-1.00). No significant trend in MRSA infection incidence rates was identified prior to or following the implementation of CHG bathing. CONCLUSIONS In this multicenter, real-world analysis of the impact of CHG bathing, hospitals that implemented CHG bathing attained a decrease in ICU CLABSIs, ICU primary BSIs, and VRE CLABSIs. CHG bathing did not affect rates of specific or overall infections due to MRSA. Our findings support daily CHG bathing of ICU patients. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2016;37:791-797.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although risk stratification is an important goal of cardiac noninvasive tests (NITs), few contemporary data exist on the prognostic value of different NITs according to patient sex. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to compare the results and prognostic information derived from anatomic versus stress testing in stable men and women with suspected coronary artery disease. METHODS: In 8,966 patients tested at randomization (4,500 to computed tomography angiography [CTA], 52% female; 4,466 to stress testing, 53% female), we assessed the relationship between sex and NIT results and between sex and a composite of death, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina hospitalization. RESULTS: In women, a positive CTA (≥70% stenosis) was less likely than a positive stress test result (8% vs. 12%; adjusted odds ratio: 0.67). Compared with negative test results, a positive CTA was more strongly associated with subsequent clinical events than a positive stress test result (CTA-adjusted hazard ratio of 5.86 vs. stress-adjusted hazard ratio of 2.27; adjusted p = 0.028). Men were more likely to have a positive CTA than a positive stress test result (16% vs. 14%; adjusted odds ratio: 1.23). Compared with negative test results, a positive CTA was less strongly associated with subsequent clinical events than a positive stress test result in men, although this difference was not statistically significant (adjusted p = 0.168). Negative CTA and stress test results were equally likely to predict an event in both sexes. A significant interaction between sex, NIT type, and test result (p = 0.01) suggests that sex and NIT type jointly influence the relationship between test result and clinical events. CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic value of an NIT result varies according to test type and patient sex. Women seem to derive more prognostic information from a CTA, whereas men tend to derive similar prognostic value from both test types.",

        "abstract": "PROBLEM: Physicians need training in community engagement, leadership, and population health to prepare them to work with partners within the community and to adapt medical care to address population health needs. APPROACH: With an overall goal of training primary care practitioners to be change agents for improving population health, the Duke University School of Medicine launched the Primary Care Leadership Track (PCLT) in 2011. The four-year PCLT curriculum requires students to contribute to existing community health initiatives, perform community-engaged research, and participate in leadership training. The clinical curriculum incorporates a longitudinal approach to allow students to follow patient outcomes. In addition, students regularly interact with faculty to explore population health issues, review patient cases, and adjust individual learning opportunities as needed. OUTCOMES: The first cohort of PCLT students will graduate in 2015. Prospective comparisons with traditional track students are planned on performance on standardized tests and career choices. NEXT STEPS: The authors created the PCLT as a laboratory in which students can engage with the community and explore solutions to address the health of the public and the future delivery of health care. To meet the goal of training change agents, PCLT leaders need to expand opportunities for students to learn from providers and organizations that are successfully bridging the gap between medical care and public health.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the effect of radial access on outcomes in women undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using a registry-based randomized trial. BACKGROUND: Women are at increased risk of bleeding and vascular complications after PCI. The role of radial access in women is unclear. METHODS: Women undergoing cardiac catheterization or PCI were randomized to radial or femoral arterial access. Data from the CathPCI Registry and trial-specific data were merged into a final study database. The primary efficacy endpoint was Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 2, 3, or 5 bleeding or vascular complications requiring intervention. The primary feasibility endpoint was access site crossover. The primary analysis cohort was the subgroup undergoing PCI; sensitivity analyses were conducted in the total randomized population. RESULTS: The trial was stopped early for a lower than expected event rate. A total of 1,787 women (691 undergoing PCI) were randomized at 60 sites. There was no significant difference in the primary efficacy endpoint between radial or femoral access among women undergoing PCI (radial 1.2% vs. 2.9% femoral, odds ratio [OR]: 0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.12 to 1.27); among women undergoing cardiac catheterization or PCI, radial access significantly reduced bleeding and vascular complications (0.6% vs. 1.7%; OR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.90). Access site crossover was significantly higher among women assigned to radial access (PCI cohort: 6.1% vs. 1.7%; OR: 3.65; 95% CI: 1.45 to 9.17); total randomized cohort: (6.7% vs. 1.9%; OR: 3.70; 95% CI: 2.14 to 6.40). More women preferred radial access. CONCLUSIONS: In this pragmatic trial, which was terminated early, the radial approach did not significantly reduce bleeding or vascular complications in women undergoing PCI. Access site crossover occurred more often in women assigned to radial access. (SAFE-PCI for Women; NCT01406236).",

        "abstract": "Sedation for the mechanically-ventilated, brain-injured patient remains challenging. The purpose of this pilot study was to compare the cerebral physiologic effects of sedation with propofol versus dexmedetomidine in mechanically-ventilated, brain-injured patients. Using a randomised, crossover, unblinded clinical trial, we enrolled patients with severe brain injury (Glasgow Coma Score ≤8) from traumatic injury, subarachnoid haemorrhage or intracerebral haemorrhage undergoing multimodal monitoring (intracranial pressure, brain temperature, oximetry and microdialysis). Patients received an infusion of either propofol or dexmedetomidine for six hours and then a crossover for the subsequent six hours after sufficient washout/in. Clinical and physiological measurements were recorded hourly. In eight patients, (four traumatic injury, three subarachnoid haemorrhage and one intracerebral haemorrhage), the mean dose of propofol used was 25.5 µg/kg/minute while the mean dose of dexmedetomidine was 0.54 µg/kg/hour. All subjects were effectively sedated to a goal of Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale -2 and Bispectral Index of 50-70 throughout the study period. We did not observe any statistically significant differences between the groups in systemic or cerebral physiologic metrics. Though differences were noted in cerebral metabolic substrates (lactate/pyruvate ratio), none were statistically significant. In our pilot cohort, dexmedetomidine and propofol appear equally effective in sedating severely brain-injured patients and neither is associated with adverse physiological effects as measured by multimodal monitoring. Larger long-term studies are required to determine whether clinically favourable benefits demonstrated in the medical critical care setting also apply to this patient population.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Randomized controlled trials can answer questions of efficacy, but long-term pharmacovigilance studies generate complementary safety data. OBJECTIVES: Level I evidence supports short-term efficacy of opioids in reducing chronic refractory dyspnea. This study aimed to determine the minimum effective once-daily dose of sustained-release morphine, and whether net clinical benefits are sustained safely. METHODS: In a Phase II dose increment study, 10mg daily of sustained-release morphine was administered, and increased in nonresponders by 10mg daily each week to a maximum of 30 mg daily. The participant was withdrawn if there were unacceptable side effects or no response to maximum dose. If participants had a 10% improvement in dyspnea over their own baseline, they joined a long-term Phase IV effectiveness/safety study at that dose. Complying with Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines, response and side effects are described, with demographic and clinical characteristics of responders. RESULTS: Eighty-three participants (53 males, mean age 75 years, 54% with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) provided more than 30 patient-years of data. Fifty-two participants derived ≥ 10% benefit (on average 35% improvement over baseline), giving a response rate of 62% (number needed to treat of 1.6: number needed to harm 4.6); for 70%, this dose was 10mg/24h. Benefit was maintained at three months for 28 (33%) people. Ranking of breathlessness was reduced significantly (P<0.001), but constipation increased (P<0.001) despite laxatives. There were no episodes of respiratory depression or hospitalizations as a result of the sustained-release morphine. Overall, one in three people continued to derive benefit at three months. CONCLUSION: Ten milligrams of sustained-release oral morphine once daily is safe and effective for most people who respond.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Longer-term pharmacologic studies for insomnia in older individuals are sparse. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of 12 weeks of nightly eszopiclone in elderly outpatients with insomnia. METHODS: Participants (65-85 years) met DSM-IV-TR criteria for insomnia with total sleep times (TST) < or = 6 h, and wake time after sleep onset (WASO) > or = 45 min. Participants were randomized to 12 weeks of eszopiclone 2 mg (n = 194) or placebo (n = 194), followed by a 2-week single-blind placebo run-out. Subject-reported measures of sleep (sTST, sleep latency [sSL], sWASO) and daytime function (alertness, concentration, wellbeing, ability to function) were assessed. AEs were monitored. RESULTS: Subjects treated with 2 mg eszopiclone slept longer at night on average and at every individual time point compared to baseline than placebo subjects, as measured by TST over the 12-week double-blind period (P < 0.0001). Mean sTST over the double-blind period for eszopiclone-treated subjects was 360.08 min compared to 297.86 min at baseline, a mean change of 63.24 min. Over the double-blind period, eszopiclone-treated subjects also experienced a significantly greater improvement in sSL compared to placebo, with a mean decrease of 24.62 min versus a mean decrease of 19.92 min, respectively (P = 0.0014). Eszopiclone subjects also experienced a significantly greater decrease in WASO (mean decrease of 36.4 min) compared to placebo subjects (decrease of 14.8 min) (P < 0.0001). Post-discontinuation, sleep parameters were statistically improved versus baseline for eszopiclone (P-values < or = 0.01), indicating no rebound. The most common AEs (> or = 5%) were headache (eszopiclone 13.9%, placebo 12.4%), unpleasant taste (12.4%, 1.5%), and nasopharyngitis (5.7%, 6.2%). CONCLUSION: In this Phase IV trial of older adults with insomnia, eszopiclone significantly improved patient-reported sleep and daytime function relative to placebo. Improvements occurred within the first week and were maintained for 3 months, with no evidence of rebound insomnia following discontinuation. The 12 weeks of treatment were well tolerated.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of etanercept alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX) in children with selected categories of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). METHODS: Patients ages 2-18 years with rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive or RF-negative polyarthritis, systemic JIA, or extended oligoarthritis were eligible for the study. Patients received MTX alone (> or =10 mg/m(2)/week [ approximately 0.3 mg/kg/week], maximum dosage 1 mg/kg/week), etanercept alone (0.8 mg/kg/week, maximum dose 50 mg), or etanercept plus MTX for 3 years in an open-label, nonrandomized study. Safety was assessed by measuring rates of adverse events, and effectiveness was assessed using the physician's global assessment of disease activity and the pediatric total joint assessment. RESULTS: A total of 197, 103, and 294 patients were enrolled in the MTX, etanercept, and etanercept plus MTX groups, respectively. Exposure-adjusted rates of adverse events were similar among the 3 treatment groups (18.3, 18.7, and 21.6 per 100 patient-years in the MTX, etanercept, and etanercept plus MTX groups, respectively). Respective rates per 100 patient-years of serious adverse events (4.6, 7.1, and 6.0) and medically important infections (1.3, 1.8, and 2.1) were also similar among the 3 treatment groups. Scores for physician's global assessment and total active joints improved from baseline, and improvement was maintained for the duration of the study. CONCLUSION: These data confirm the findings of other long-term studies and suggest that etanercept or etanercept plus MTX has an acceptable safety and effectiveness profile in children with selected categories of JIA. Improvement was maintained for 3 years in those continuing to receive medication.",

        "abstract": "The prognosis for patients with metastatic breast cancer remains poor. Metastatic breast cancer confined to the bones may have a better prognosis, especially hormone receptor-positive disease. We performed a prospective, randomized clinical trial to compare immediate consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic support versus observation with high-dose consolidation at the time of disease progression in women with metastatic breast cancer and only bone metastases. The patients received chemotherapy with doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil and methotrexate before randomization. In all, 85 patients were enrolled and 69 were randomized. The median follow-up is 8.1 years from randomization. The median event-free survival (EFS) for the immediate transplant arm is 12 months and for the observation arm is 4.3 months (P<0.0001). The median overall survival for the immediate transplant arm is 2.97 years and for the observation arm 1.81 years, a difference that is not statistically significant. Immediate high-dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy as consolidation offers a clinically and statistically significant improvement in EFS compared with radiation therapy alone following induction chemotherapy for women with metastatic breast cancer confined to the bones.",

        "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the frequency of adverse effects of remifentanil and fentanyl in a large and diverse patient population. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, open-label study. SETTING: Multicenter study including academic and community hospitals. PATIENTS: 2,438 adult patients (1,496 outpatients and 942 inpatients) scheduled for elective surgical procedures under general endotracheal anesthesia of at least 30-minute duration. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous (IV) remifentanil (n = 1,229) 0.5 microg/kg/min for induction and tracheal intubation followed by an infusion rate of 0.25 microg/kg/min or fentanyl (n = 1,209) administered according to the anesthesiologist's usual practice. Anesthesia was maintained with propofol and/or isoflurane (with or without nitrous oxide) titrated according to protocol. Transition analgesia with either morphine or fentanyl was administered in the remifentanil and, at the anesthesiologist's discretion, in the fentanyl group. MEASUREMENTS: The overall nonspecific and specific (i.e., opioid-related) adverse effects were recorded. MAIN RESULTS: Remifentanil was associated with more intraoperative hypotension than fentanyl (p < 0.05). All four cases (0.3%) of muscle rigidity occurred in the remifentanil-treated outpatients. There were no significant differences between the two drugs with respect to other adverse events (i.e., episodes of hypertension, bradycardia, respiratory depression, and apnea). CONCLUSIONS: In the doses used, both remifentanil and fentanyl have a similar frequency of adverse effects except for the higher frequency of hypotension associated with the use of remifentanil.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Warfarin is used for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. However, it is associated with rates of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of approximately 38% to 55% and requires routine coagulation monitoring and frequent dose adjustment. Ximelagatran, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, has shown promising efficacy and tolerability in patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of ximelagatran and warfarin for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism after total knee arthroplasty. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial. SETTING: 74 North American hospitals. PATIENTS: 680 patients who had undergone total knee arthroplasty. INTERVENTION: 7 to 12 days of treatment with oral ximelagatran, 24 mg twice daily, starting on the morning after surgery, or warfarin (target international normalized ratio, 2.5 [range, 1.8 to 3.0]), starting on the evening of the day of surgery. MEASUREMENTS: Principal end points were asymptomatic DVT on mandatory venography; symptomatic DVT confirmed by ultrasonography or venography; symptomatic, objectively proven pulmonary embolism; and bleeding. All were assessed by blinded adjudication locally and at a central study laboratory. RESULTS: On central adjudication, incidence of venous thromboembolism was 19.2% (53 of 276 patients) in the ximelagatran group and 25.7% (67 of 261 patients) in the warfarin group (difference, -6.5 percentage points [95% CI, -13.5 to 0.6 percentage points]; P = 0.070). On local assessment, incidence was 25.4% in the ximelagatran group and 33.5% in the warfarin group (P = 0.043). In the ximelagatran and warfarin groups, respectively, major bleeding occurred in 1.7% and 0.9% of patients and minor bleeding occurred in 7.8% and 6.4% of patients. No variables related to bleeding differed significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: For prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism, fixed-dose ximelagatran started the morning after total knee arthroplasty is well tolerated and at least as effective as warfarin, but it does not require coagulation monitoring or dose adjustment.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The rationale for treating patients with psychotic major depression (PMD) with glucocorticosteroid receptor (GR) antagonists is explained. METHODS: Thirty patients with PMD, with Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-21) scores of 18 or greater, were assigned in an open label trial to receive 50 mg, 600 mg, or 1200 mg of mifepristone for 7 days. RESULTS: All the subjects completed the protocol; there were no dropouts. Side effects were mild and sporadic. Of 19 subjects in the combined 600- and 1200-mg group, 13 had a 30% or greater decline in their Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores, compared with 4 of 11 in the 50-mg group. In the 600- and 1200-mg group, 12 of 19 subjects showed a 50% decline in the BPRS positive symptom subscale, a more sensitive index for the symptoms seen in PMD, compared with 3 of 11 in the 50-mg group; 8 of 19 subjects in the 600- and 1200-mg group had a 50% decline in the HAMD-21, compared with 2 of 11 in the 50-mg group. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that short term use of GR antagonists may be effective in the treatment of psychotic major depression and that further blinded studies are warranted.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hemoglobin increases have been associated with quality of life (QOL) improvements in anemic cancer patients treated with epoetin alfa, but intervention generally has been reserved for symptomatic anemia or hemoglobin < 10 g/dL. Relationships among hemoglobin, functional status, and patient reported QOL have not been well characterized. METHODS: Data from two open-label, community-based trials of epoetin alfa therapy that enrolled 4382 anemic cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy were used to evaluate the relationship between hemoglobin changes and QOL changes. The authors measured QOL using the Linear Analog Scale Assessment (LASA) and the more detailed, disease-specific Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An) instrument. Analyses were performed to determine the incremental change in QOL associated with hemoglobin increases (1 g/dL increments). RESULTS: Cross-sectional analyses showed a nonlinear relationship and significant positive correlation between high hemoglobin levels and high LASA and FACT-An scores (r = 0.25 and 0.29, respectively, P < 0.01). Patients with hemoglobin increases of > or = 2 g/dL reported statistically significant improvements in five FACT-An items selected a priori specifically to reflect functional capacity. An incremental analysis used regression methods to identify the longitudinal relationship between incremental changes in hemoglobin and QOL scores. This relationship was found to be nonlinear, with the maximum QOL gain occurring at a hemoglobin level of 12 g/dL (range, 11-13 g/dL). Patients with low baseline QOL scores and longer time periods between baseline and final QOL assessments experienced significantly (P < 0.05) greater increases in overall QOL. Progressive disease at baseline, change in disease status from baseline to end of study, and increase in self-reported pain or nausea all had significant (P < 0.05) negative effects on QOL scores. CONCLUSIONS: A direct relationship exists between hemoglobin increases during epoetin alfa therapy and corresponding QOL improvements in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy across the clinically relevant hemoglobin range of 8-14 g/dL. These data suggest that the maximal incremental gain in QOL occurs when hemoglobin is in the range of 11-13 g/dL.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) have high mortality from bone marrow failure or transformation to acute leukemia. Supportive care is standard therapy. We previously reported that azacitidine (Aza C) was active in patients with high-risk MDS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was undertaken in 191 patients with MDS to compare Aza C (75 mg/m(2)/d subcutaneously for 7 days every 28 days) with supportive care. MDS was defined by French-American-British criteria. New rigorous response criteria were applied. Both arms received transfusions and antibiotics as required. Patients in the supportive care arm whose disease worsened were permitted to cross over to Aza C. RESULTS: Responses occurred in 60% of patients on the Aza C arm (7% complete response, 16% partial response, 37% improved) compared with 5% (improved) receiving supportive care (P <.001). Median time to leukemic transformation or death was 21 months for Aza C versus 13 months for supportive care (P =.007). Transformation to acute myelogenous leukemia occurred as the first event in 15% of patients on the Aza C arm and in 38% receiving supportive care (P =.001). Eliminating the confounding effect of early cross-over to Aza C, a landmark analysis after 6 months showed median survival of an additional 18 months for Aza C and 11 months for supportive care (P =.03). Quality-of-life assessment found significant major advantages in physical function, symptoms, and psychological state for patients initially randomized to Aza C. CONCLUSION: Aza C treatment results in significantly higher response rates, improved quality of life, reduced risk of leukemic transformation, and improved survival compared with supportive care. Aza C provides a new treatment option that is superior to supportive care for patients with the MDS subtypes and specific entry criteria treated in this study.",

All patients received etoposide 75 mg/m2, ifosfamide 1.2 g/m2 and cisplatin 20 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1-4 every 3 weeks for four cycles. Non-progressing patients were randomized to oral etoposide 50 mg/m2 for 21 consecutive days every 4 weeks for three courses versus no further therapy until progression. RESULTS: From September 1993 to June 1998, 233 patients were entered and treated with VIP with 144 non-progressing patients subsequently randomized to oral etoposide (n = 72) or observation (n = 72). Minimum follow up for all patients is 2 years. Toxicity with oral etoposide was mild. There was an improvement in median PFS favoring the maintenance arm of 8.23 versus 6.5 months (P = 0.0018). There was a trend towards an improvement in median (12.2 versus 11.2 months), 1-year (51.4% versus 40.3%), 2-year (16.7% versus 6.9%) and 3-year (9.1% versus 1.9%) survival (P = 0.0704) favoring the maintenance arm. CONCLUSIONS: Three months of oral etoposide in non-progressing patients with extensive SCLC was associated with a significant improvement in PFS and a trend towards improved overall survival.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: We sought to determine whether therapy with single-agent fludarabine compared with chlorambucil alone or the combination of both agents had an impact on the incidence and spectrum of infections among a series of previously untreated patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five hundred fifty-four previously untreated CLL patients with intermediate/high-risk Rai-stage disease were enrolled onto an intergroup protocol. Patients were randomized to therapy with chlorambucil, fludarabine, or fludarabine plus chlorambucil. Data pertaining to infection were available on 518 patients. Differences in infections among treatment arms were tested with the Kruskal-Wallis, Wilcoxon, and chi(2) tests. RESULTS: A total of 1,107 infections (241 major infections) occurred in 518 patients over the infection follow-up period (interval from study entry until either reinstitution of initial therapy, therapy with a second agent, or death). Patients treated with fludarabine plus chlorambucil had more infections than those receiving either single agent (P <.0001). Comparing the two single-agent arms, there were more infections on the fludarabine arm (P =.055) per month of follow-up. Fludarabine therapy was associated with more major infections and more herpesvirus infections compared with chlorambucil (P =.008 and P =.004, respectively). Rai stage and best response to therapy were not associated with infection. A low serum immunoglobulin G was associated with number of infections (P =.02). Age was associated with incidence of major infection in the combination arm (P =.004). CONCLUSION: Combination therapy with fludarabine plus chlorambucil resulted in significantly more infections than treatment with either single agent. Patients receiving single-agent fludarabine had more major infections and herpesvirus infections compared with chlorambucil-treated patients.",

        "abstract": "MSL-109 is a monoclonal antibody specific to the cytomegalovirus (CMV) glycoprotein H with high neutralizing capacity. In a prospective, randomized, double-blind study, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients with positive donor and/or recipient serology for CMV before transplantation received either 60 mg/kg MSL-109 (n = 59), 15 mg/kg MSL-109 (n = 60), or placebo (n = 60) intravenously every 2 weeks from day -1 until day 84 after transplantation. CMV pp65 antigenemia, CMV-DNA load in plasma, and viremia by culture were tested weekly. Primary end points were development of pp65 antigenemia at any level and/or viremia for which ganciclovir was given. There was no statistically significant difference in CMV pp65 antigenemia or viremia among patients in the 60-mg group (pp65 antigenemia, 47%; viremia, 15%), the 15-mg group (52%; 23%), and the placebo group (45%; 17%). There was also no difference in maximum levels of pp65 antigenemia, time to clearance of pp65 antigenemia after start of ganciclovir, CMV disease, invasive bacterial and fungal infections, time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment, acute graft-versus-host disease, days of hospitalization, and overall survival rate among the 3 groups. However, a subgroup analysis of CMV-seronegative recipients with a seropositive donor (D+/R-) showed a transiently improved survival rate by day 100 in MSL-109 recipients (mortality: 60-mg group, 1/13; 15-mg group, 1/12; placebo group, 6/10 [P = .02 for 60-mg versus placebo groups; P = .08 for 15-mg versus placebo groups]); by the end of follow-up, the difference was no longer statistically significant. The improved survival rate in D+/R- patients could not be attributed to a reduction in CMV disease; however, MSL-109 was associated with improved platelet engraftment and less grade III to IV acute graft-versus-host disease in this subgroup. In a subgroup analysis of CMV-seropositive recipients of MSL-109 (D+/R+ and D-/R+), overall mortality was increased compared to that of the placebo group (P = .12 for the 60-mg versus placebo groups, P = .05 for the 15-mg versus placebo groups, and P = .04 for the dose levels combined versus placebo). MSL-109 was well tolerated and no immune response to the drug was observed. Thus, MSL-109 was safe but did not reduce CMV infection in allogeneic HSCT recipients. The transient survival advantage seen early after transplantation in CMV D+/R- patients and the negative effect on survival in seropositive patients remain unexplained. Thus, there is no evidence that MSL-109 is beneficial in CMV-seropositive HSCT recipients.",

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This was an open-label, multi-institutional randomized trial in 303 H/N cancer patients treated with RT +amifostine. Clinical benefit was measured using an 8-item validated Patient Benefit Questionnaire (PBQ) during and up to 11 months after RT. RESULTS: 301 patients completed one or more PBQ assessments. Amifostine patients had significantly better PBQ scores (p < 0.05) than controls. The improvement in PBQ scores was most significant during chronic xerostomia. CONCLUSIONS: Amifostine use results in improved Patient Benefit Questionnaire (PBQ) scores, which is indicative of improved oral toxicity related outcomes and improved clinical benefit. Less oral toxicity should lead to preservation of late dental and oral health, and improvements in activities such as diet, nutrition, and sleep.",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: We compared the effects of remifentanil versus fentanyl during surgery for intracranial space-occupying lesions. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either remifentanil (0.5 microg. kg(-1). min(-1) IV during the induction of anesthesia reduced to 0.25 microg. kg(-1). min(-1) after endotracheal intubation; n = 49) or fentanyl (dose per usual practice of the anesthesiologist; n = 54). Anesthesia maintenance doses of isoflurane, nitrous oxide, and opioid were at the anesthesiologist's discretion for both groups. There were no differences between opioid groups for the frequency of responses (hemodynamic, movement, and tearing) to intubation, pinhead holder placement, skin incision, or closure of the surgical wound. Adverse event frequencies were similar between groups. Times to follow verbal commands (P < 0.001) and tracheal extubation (P = 0. 04) were more rapid for remifentanil. The percentage of patients with a normal recovery score (were alert or arousable to quiet voice, were oriented, were able to follow commands, had motor function unchanged from their preoperative evaluation, were not agitated, and had modified Aldrete Scores of 9-10) at 10 min after surgery was more for remifentanil (45% vs 18%; P = 0.005). By 20 min, no difference between groups existed (P = 0.27). Anesthesiologists used more isoflurane in the fentanyl group (4.22 vs 1.93 minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration hours). Neurosurgeons, blinded to treatment group, favored the use of remifentanil. Similar frequencies of light anesthesia responses and other adverse events suggest that intraoperative depths of anesthesia were similar in the two groups. Under these conditions, emergence was more rapid with remifentanil. This is consistent with the necessity for less isoflurane use in the remifentanil group and the intrinsic rapid clearance of this opioid. IMPLICATIONS: Patients given remifentanil-based anesthesia for craniotomy had faster recovery times from anesthesia than did those given fentanyl-based anesthesia.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To test the following hypothesis: The greater the increase in the mean computed tomographic (CT) number of a radiologically indeterminate lung nodule from the CT number on a 140-kVp CT image to that on an 80-kVp CT image, the more likely the nodule is benign (ie, contains calcium). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred forty indeterminate lung nodules were prospectively studied at four institutions: Mayo Clinic Scottsdale, Ariz (n = 160); Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minn (n = 50); Shiga Health Insurance Hospital, Otsu, Japan (n = 25); and Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC (n = 5). Of the 240 nodules, 157 met the entrance criteria for this study and had a diagnosis. All nodules included were solid, 5-40-mm diameter, relatively spherical, homogeneous, and without visible evidence of calcification or fat. Each nodule was evaluated by using 3-mm-collimation, nonenhanced CT scans with both 140- and 80-kVp x-ray beams. RESULTS: There were 86 (55%) benign and 71 (45%) malignant nodules. The median increase in the nodule mean CT number from the CT number on 140-kVp images to that on 80-kVp images was 2 HU for benign nodules and 3 HU for malignant nodules. This difference was not statistically significant. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.505. CONCLUSION: Dual-kilovolt peak analysis with current CT technology does not appear to be helpful in the identification of benign lung nodules.",

Monomorphic PCR products were screened for polymorphisms by the SSCP technique. Sequencing confirmed that SSCP's were mostly due to single nucleotide substitutions in the polymorphic fragments. A total of 85 polymorphic loci were observed within 13 PCR fragments. Populations from Africa displayed less genotype variation than the populations from Europe and USA. Two genetically similar African C. albicans populations exhibiting an atypical biotype were strictly clonal and perhaps represent a geographically distributed clone. Analyses of \"typical\" C. albicans populations of different geographical origin provided however evidence for both clonality and recombination. Evidence for clonality was supported by the absence of segregation genotypes, and by deviation of genotypic frequencies from Hardy-Weinberg expectations. Tests for nonrandom association of alleles across loci revealed less evidence for linkage disequilibrium than expected for strictly clonal populations. Although all C. albicans populations tested were primarily clonal, evidence for recombination suggests that sexual reproduction or some other form of genetic exchange occurs in this species.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy of neoadjuvant methotrexate, cisplatin, and vinblastine (MCV) chemotherapy in patients with muscle-invading bladder cancer treated with selective bladder preservation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-three eligible patients with tumor, node, metastasis system clinical stage T2 to T4aNXMO bladder cancer were randomized to receive (arm 1, n=61 ) two cycles of MCV before 39.6-Gy pelvic irradiation with concurrent cisplatin 100 mg/m2 for two courses 3 weeks apart. Patients assigned to arm 2 (n=62) did not receive MCV before concurrent cisplatin and radiation therapy. Tumor response was scored as a clinical complete response (CR) when the cystoscopic tumor-site biopsy and urine cytology results were negative. The CR patients were treated with an additional 25.2 Gy to a total of 64.8 Gy and one additional dose of cisplatin. Those with less than a CR underwent cystectomy. The median follow-up of all patients who survived is 60 months. RESULTS: Seventy-four percent of the patients completed the protocol with, at most, minor deviations; 67% on arm 1 and 81% on arm 2. The actuarial 5-year overall survival rate was 49%; 48% in arm 1 and 49% in arm 2. Thirty-five percent of the patients had evidence of distant metastases at 5 years; 33% in arm 1 and 39% in arm 2. The 5-year survival rate with a functioning bladder was 38%, 36% in arm 1 and 40% in arm 2. None of these differences are statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Two cycles of MCV neoadjuvant chemotherapy were not shown to increase the rate of CR over that achieved with our standard induction therapy or to increase freedom from metastatic disease. There was no impact on 5-year overall survival.",

        "abstract": "Mice lacking the the plasma membrane dopamine transporter (DAT), following gene inactivation or knock out, show an increase in their spontaneous locomotor activity that is of the same magnitude than in normal mice treated with amphetamine or cocaine, known to increase levels of dopamine in the basal ganglia. Many adaptive responses have occurred in these animals than could not compensate for the hyper activity of the dopamine system. Surprisingly, while intracellular dopamine levels were of only 5%, extracellular dopamine levels were increased by 300%. We investigated the regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate limiting enzyme of dopamine synthesis, and found that this enzyme is regulated at the levels of mRNA, protein, trafficking as well as in its regional, cellular and subcellular organization. Our results establish not only the central importance of the transporter as the key element controlling dopamine levels in the brain, but also its role in the behavioral and biochemical action of amphetamine, cocaine and morphine. In addition, these mice have provided key elements leading to possible clinical and social implications for illnesses such as Parkinson disease, attention deficit disorder and drug addiction.",

        "abstract": "The safety and clinical efficacy of a liquid, beta-propiolactone-stabilized intravenous gamma-globulin, Intraglobin-F, was evaluated in a multicenter, double-blind study comparing Intraglobin-F to Gamimune-N, Sandoglobulin, or Gammagard. beta-Propiolactone stabilizes the IgG molecule to decrease aggregate formation and is a potent virucidal agent that reduces the risk of viral transmission by intravenous gamma-globulin (IVIG) preparations. Twenty-seven patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases were enrolled at three centers. Each patient received 6 months of therapy with either Intraglobin-F or the IVIG preparation that they had received during the preceding 3 months, then crossed over to the other preparation. Twenty-three patients completed the study. One patient withdrew because of an adverse event, generalized urticaria. A second patient withdrew because of fatigue and perceived decreased efficacy. Adverse reactions were comparable and occurred in 8.7% of the infusions of Intraglobin-F and 6% of the infusions with Sandoglobulin. None were severe or life-threatening. There was no discernible difference in efficacy between any of the products. The number of days when patients noted symptoms in their diaries was similar for Intraglobin-F and the comparison preparations, 4158 vs 4143. Similarly, there were no differences in the number of physician visits (33 vs 22), days missed from work or school (405 vs 404), days with fever (41 vs 47), or days of prophylactic antibiotics (675 vs 642). There was an increase in the number of days when antibiotics were given therapeutically (578 vs 451); most of the difference was attributable to one patient. There also was a difference in the number of days of hospitalization (21 vs 0), but 19 of the days were accounted for by two patients. When the patients were asked to score their feeling of well-being on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being entirely well, the mean score for the patients on Intraglobin-F was 1.86 (range, 1.0 to 3.0), compared to 1.85 (range, 1.0 to 3.2) for patients while on the comparison preparations. Trough IgG levels were slightly lower during the period when patients were treated with Intraglobin-F compared to the other products. There were no abnormalities in blood chemistries or hematologic parameters. Thus, Intraglobin-F is comparable to three of the marketed IVIG preparations in efficacy and safety, as well as patient acceptability, and offers the additional benefit of an extra virucidal step to reduce further the risk of transmitting viral infections.",

Forty-three patients, 15 to 54 (median 41) years of age, were transplanted for hematologic malignancies. Thirty-seven of 43 evaluable patients had evidence of sustained marrow engraftment. Five patients died before day 17 after transplantation. The median time to an absolute neutrophil count of > 0.5 x 10(5)/L was 21 (range, 14 to 30) days. Nephrotoxicity (serum creatinine concentration > 2 mg/dL or doubling of baseline) occurred in 32 patients (74% cumulative incidence during the first 100 days after transplant). Other adverse effects included hypertension (n = 27), hyperglycemia (n = 27), neurotoxicity (n = 9) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (n = 2). Severe veno-occlusive disease of the liver occurred in 9 (21%) of the 43 patients. Eighteen patients (42%) developed grades II to IV acute GVHD and five (12%) developed grades III to IV acute GVHD. Twelve of 25 evaluable patients developed extensive chronic GVHD within 1 year of marrow transplantation resulting in an estimate of the probability of developing this complication of 48%. The cumulative incidence of transplant-related mortality during the first 100 days was 37%. Kaplan-Meier estimates of disease-free survival at 2 years for good-risk, poor-risk, and all patients were 65%, 4%, and 32%, respectively. FK506 in combination with a short course of MTX appears active in preventing acute GVHD after marrow transplantation from unrelated donors. Further studies comparing the combination of FK506 and MTX with cyclosporine and MTX for the prevention of acute GVHD are warranted.",

        "abstract": "While allogeneic marrow transplantation is curative therapy for patients with sickle cell anemia, only a small fraction of patients in the United States receive this treatment. We surveyed participants in our multicenter study of marrow transplantation for sickle cell anemia to determine reasons for not proceeding to transplantation. Among the 4848 patients less than 16 years of age with sickle cell anemia that were followed in 22 collaborating centers, 315 (6.5%) patients were reported to meet protocol entry criteria for transplantation, although there was wide variation among the institutions (0.9-36%). Among the 315 patients eligible for transplantation, 128 (41%) had human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing performed, and of these 44 (14% of those meeting entry criteria) had an HLA-identical sibling. Common reasons for not proceeding with HLA typing in the remaining 187 patients included lack of a candidate sibling donor (76 patients, 24% of those meeting criteria) and lack of financial or psychosocial support (33, 10.5%). Parental refusal (30, 9.5%), physician refusal (13, 4%), history of medical noncompliance (2, < 1%), and other reasons (33, 10.5%) were less frequently cited. To date, 25 patients have been transplanted. Of the remaining 19 patients with HLA-matched donors, seven did not proceed to transplantation because of parental refusal, while the others anticipate a future transplantation (6), have experienced symptomatic improvement (4), or have relocated abroad (2). We conclude that the major barrier to marrow transplantation for sickle cell anemia is lack of an HLA-identical donor. But since only 6.5% of all children with sickle cell disease were considered eligible for transplantation, it is possible that other significant obstacles remain to be identified. For patients reported to meet eligibility criteria, parental refusal and limited financial or psychosocial support were infrequent barriers to transplantation.",

It was shown that pyracetam (l mM) in vitro increases the K(+)-stimulated (28 mM) DA release from the perfused isolated striatum to 148 +/- 14 pmole/mg tissue compared to the control animals: 101 +/- 10 pmole /mg (p < 0.05, Student's t-test). Pyracetam in a dose of 100 mg/kg increased the DA level and decreased the 5-HT level in the striatum homogenates: DA- to 121% and 5-HT-to 81% (p < 0.05), respectively. The content of DOPAC, HVA and 5-HIAA in the tissue remained the same. In addition to the mentioned effects pyracetam promoted the locomotion activity of rats in the \"open field\" -putative behavioral marker of the striatum DA-ergic function. Thus pyracetam is capable of modifying the DA-ergic activity of the rat striatum, thus stimulating the neuromediator release.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Treatment with interleukin-2 (IL-2) and lymphokine-activated killer cells (LAK) resulted in responses in some patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, the relative therapeutic benefit of the addition of LAK to IL-2 was unknown. METHODS: A randomized Phase III trial was conducted in patients with RCC comparing continuous intravenous infusion (CI) IL-2 alone with CI IL-2 plus LAK. Interleukin-2 was administered at 3 x 10(6) U/m2/day on days 1-5, 13-17, 21-24, and 28-31. Patients on the LAK treatment arm underwent leukapheresis on days 8-10 and LAK cell reinfusion on days 13-15. The results are reported with long-term follow-up. The published experience with IL-2 alone or with the addition of LAK was investigated in a quantitative literature survey. The response proportions were studied by schedule (high dose bolus, moderate dose, low dose) and by concomitant administration of LAK. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients were treated, 36 on the IL-2 arm and 35 on the IL-2 plus LAK arm. Four patients (6%) had major responses (two complete, two partial). The median survival of all patients was 13 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 9-18 months). There were no differences between treatment arms with regard to response (P = 0.61) and survival (P = 0.67). More patients on the LAK arm experienced pulmonary toxicity (P = 0.008). The overall weighted response proportion was 16% (95% CI, 8%-24%) for the 39 published series of 1291 patients treated with IL-2. The 95% confidence intervals for response proportion overlapped when compared by schedule and by administration of LAK. CONCLUSIONS: The dose and schedule of IL-2 used in this study resulted in a low level of antitumor activity and the addition of LAK did not improve the response rate against RCC. Given the infrequent, but reproducible, responses with IL-2 and interferon-based regimens, continued investigation of these agents is warranted as is the study of new cytokines. Alternative treatment strategies should be studied in RCC and new agents and treatment regimens that appear promising in Phase II studies must be studied in randomized trials.",

The respirable fraction of sandy loam-soils averaged 0.04 (SD 0.02) versus 0.13 (SD 0.03) for clay soils and 0.04 (SD 0.03) for sandy soils. Quartz content in the 4.25 mu m fraction of sandy-loam soils averaged 15.2 (SD 4.1) % versus 2.2 (SD 0.8) % in clay soils and 29.0 (SD 11.1) % in sandy soils. The mass of respirable quartz in sandy-loam soils averaged 0.7 (SD 0.4)% versus 0.3 (SD 0.1)% in clay soils and 1.0 (SD 0.4) % in sandy soils.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Because of pending efforts to reform health care in the United States, judicious use of low-osmolality contrast media is important. We studied the effects of using various concentrations and volumes of iohexol, compared with the conventional dose and concentration of diatrizoate meglumine used for CT, to determine if a more cost-effective dose results in diagnostically efficacious liver enhancement. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 902 patients received one of nine different doses of IV contrast media. Eight doses of iohexol were used: 125 ml of iohexol 350 (350 mg l/ml, 44 g l/dose), 100 ml of iohexol 350 (35 g l/dose), 150 ml of iohexol 300 (300 mg l/ml, 45 g l/dose), 120 ml of iohexol 300 (36 g l/dose), 100 ml of iohexol 300 (30 g l/dose), 175 ml of iohexol 240 (240 mg l/ml, 42 g l/dose), 150 ml of iohexol 240 (36 g l/dose), and 125 ml of iohexol 240 (30 g l/dose). A single dose (150 ml) of diatrizoate meglumine 60% (w/v) was used (42 g l/dose). Contrast material was injected at a rate of 2 ml/sec. Scanning began 35-45 sec after injection. Quantitative analysis of enhancement was performed by obtaining region-of-interest measurements through the liver on scans obtained before and after injection of contrast material. Mean and maximum changes in hepatic density and mean time to maximum enhancement were measured. Mean time-density curves were subsequently derived for each dose of contrast material. Qualitative analysis of enhancement was performed by using subjective, previously defined criteria. All studies were interpreted in a double-blind fashion. RESULTS: Mean hepatic enhancement was greater with 125 ml of iohexol 350 and 150 ml of iohexol 300 than with other doses of contrast material (p < .05). Both 125 ml of iohexol 350 and 150 ml of iohexol 300 produced actual hepatic enhancement of more than 50 H for over 60 sec. The greatest maximum increase in hepatic density occurred with 125 ml of iohexol 350. When analyzed qualitatively, 150 ml of iohexol 300 resulted in the highest percentage of optimum enhancement. CONCLUSION: According to quantitative analysis, 125 ml of iohexol 350 administered at a rate of 2 ml/sec produces the best enhancement, whereas according to qualitative analysis, 150 ml of iohexol 300 produces the best enhancement. All doses of iohexol 240 provide poor enhancement compared with a conventional dose of contrast material of 150 ml of diatrizoate meglumine 60% or 150 ml of iohexol 300. A moderate cost savings can be achieved by using 125 ml of iohexol 350 for dynamic sequential CT.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation remains a serious problem. In a clinical trial, we tested the combination of cyclosporine and prednisone with and without methotrexate for the prevention of GVHD. METHODS: One hundred fifty patients with either acute leukemia in first complete remission, chronic myelogenous leukemia in first chronic phase, or lymphoblastic lymphoma in first complete remission were enrolled in the study. All the patients were given fractionated total-body irradiation (1320 cGy) and etoposide (60 mg per kilogram of body weight) in preparation for transplantation, and received bone marrow from genotypically histocompatible donors. To prevent GVHD, they were randomly assigned to prophylactic treatment with either cyclosporine, methotrexate, and prednisone or cyclosporine and prednisone without methotrexate. All the patients received standardized supportive care after transplantation, including intravenous gamma globulin. RESULTS: Patients receiving cyclosporine, methotrexate, and prednisone had a significantly lower incidence of acute GVHD of grades II to IV (9 percent) than those receiving cyclosporine and prednisone (23 percent, P = 0.02). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that an increased risk of acute GVHD was associated with an elevated serum creatinine concentration (P = 0.006) and treatment with cyclosporine and prednisone alone (P = 0.02). The lower incidence of acute GVHD was not associated with a higher rate of relapse of leukemia or lymphoma. There was no significant difference in disease-free survival at three years between the two treatment groups (64 percent with the three-drug regimen vs. 59 percent with the two-drug regimen, P = 0.57). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of cyclosporine, methotrexate, and prednisone was more effective in preventing acute GVHD of grades II to IV than was the combination of cyclosporine and prednisone without methotrexate.",

One hundred twenty-three patients with recurrent infections and severe chronic neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 0.5 x 10(9)/L) due to these diseases were enrolled in this multicenter phase III trial. They were randomized to either immediately beginning recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (filgrastim) (3.45 to 11.50 micrograms/kg/d, subcutaneously) or entering a 4-month observation period followed by filgrastim administration. Blood neutrophil counts, bone marrow (BM) cell histology, and incidence and duration of infection-related events were monitored. Of the 123 patients enrolled, 120 received filgrastim. On therapy, 108 patients had a median absolute neutrophil count of > or = 1.5 x 10(9)/L. Examination of BM aspirates showed increased proportions of maturing neutrophils. Infection-related events were significantly decreased (P < .05) with approximately 50% reduction in the incidence and duration of infection-related events and almost 70% reduction in duration of antibiotic use. Asymptomatic splenic enlargement occurred frequently; adverse events frequently reported were bone pain, headache, and rash, which were generally mild and easily manageable. These data indicate that treatment of patients with severe chronic neutropenia with filgrastim results in a stimulation of BM production and maturation of neutrophils, an increase in circulating neutrophils, and a reduction in infection-related events.",

Significantly higher tumor uptake and tumor/liver or tumor/blood uptake ratios were seen in animals receiving intraportal injection for all tested doses. Intraportal injection of specific monoclonal antibody resulted in significant improvement in metastases uptake; these findings could be applied to the diagnosis and treatment of hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer using radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies.",

The effects of the variable coil length the winding density, and the antenna insertion depth in the tissue on the heating patterns from a single antenna were characterized in phantom models. Results indicated that the helical coil microwave antenna provided localized heat at depth near the antenna tip, and the heating patterns were easily modified by minor changes in the coil length, winding density, and altering the separation gap. The characteristics of the helical coil microwave antenna may increase its potential application to cases of interstitial hyperthermia.",

The article \"examines the empirical validity of this assumption by using data from the decennial censuses for 1940-1980 and, in light of substantial decade to decade changes in the age patterns of the institutional proportions for sex- and race-specific populations, seeks to develop alternative methods.\"  As part of these alternative methods, \"parametric curves are fit to the age-specific institutional proportions for each population for each decade.  A study of the observed historical variation in the parameters of these curves then leads to some suggestions about how their shapes can be estimated between censuses and projected beyond the latest available census to provide more accurate estimates and projections of the civilian noninstitutional population.\"  This is a revised version of a paper originally presented at the 1984 Annual Meeting of the Population Association of America (see Population Index, Vol. 50, No. 3, Fall 1984, p.  439).",

        "abstract": "There is considerable variation in the length of the postpartum amenorrhea during which breastfeeding suppresses fertility, both within and between societies. In this paper, we investigate the association between breastfeeding and the resumption of menses and the impact of various biological and social covariates thereon, using data from two retrospective surveys in India. We use both univariate life table and multivariate time-dependent hazards techniques to analyze the data. Most prior investigations related the impact of breastfeeding to postpartum amenorrhea by taking duration of breastfeeding as a fixed covariate. However, breastfeeding beyond the resumption of menstruation cannot affect the duration of menses. Accordingly, the present study has a methodological focus in the sense that breastfeeding is treated as a time-dependent covariate. We found that breastfeeding, age of mother at child's birth, social status, level of income, religion and caste (subcaste), and residential status have significant effects on return of menses in Indian traditional society.",
