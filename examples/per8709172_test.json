        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Male obesity has profound effects on morbidity and mortality, but relatively little is known about the impact of obesity on gametes and the potential for adverse effects of male obesity to be passed to the next generation. DNA methylation contributes to gene regulation and is erased and re-established during gametogenesis. Throughout post-pubertal spermatogenesis, there are continual needs to both maintain established methylation and complete DNA methylation programming, even during epididymal maturation. This dynamic epigenetic landscape may confer increased vulnerability to environmental influences, including the obesogenic environment, that could disrupt reprogramming fidelity. Here we conducted an exploratory analysis that showed that overweight/obesity (n = 20) is associated with differences in mature spermatozoa DNA methylation profiles relative to controls with normal BMI (n = 47). RESULTS: We identified 3264 CpG sites in human sperm that are significantly associated with BMI (p < 0.05) using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. These CpG sites were significantly overrepresented among genes involved in transcriptional regulation and misregulation in cancer, nervous system development, and stem cell pluripotency. Analysis of individual sperm using bisulfite sequencing of cloned alleles revealed that the methylation differences are present in a subset of sperm rather than being randomly distributed across all sperm. CONCLUSIONS: Male obesity is associated with altered sperm DNA methylation profiles that appear to affect reprogramming fidelity in a subset of sperm, suggestive of an influence on the spermatogonia. Further work is required to determine the potential heritability of these DNA methylation alterations. If heritable, these changes have the potential to impede normal development.",

        "abstract": "Animal experiments have demonstrated that diets high in fats create a harmful environment for developing sperm cells, contributing to impaired reproductive health and induced risk for chronic diseases in the next generation. Changes at the level of the epigenome have been suggested to underlie these observations. Human data are limited to verify this hypothesis. While we earlier demonstrated a link between male obesity and DNA methylation changes at imprinted genes in mature sperm cells and newborns, it is currently unknown if -or how- a paternal eating pattern (related to obesity) is related to indices for epigenetic inheritance. We here aim to examine a yet unexplored link between consumption of healthy (rich in vitamins and fibers) or unhealthy (\"fast\") foods and methylation at imprint regulatory regions in DNA of sperm. We obtained semen and data from 67 men, as part of a North Carolina-based study: The Influence of the Environment on Gametic Epigenetic Reprogramming (TIEGER) study. Dietary data included intake of fruits/nuts, vegetables/soups, whole grain bread, meat, seafood/fish, and fatty or processed food items. Multiple regression models were used to explore the association between dietary habits and clinical sperm parameters as well as DNA methylation levels, quantified using bisulfite pyrosequencing at 12 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of the following imprinted genes: GRB10, IGF2, H19, MEG3, NDN, NNAT, PEG1/MEST, PEG3, PLAGL1, SNRPN, and SGCE/PEG10. After adjusting for age, obesity status and recruitment method, we found that Total Motile Count (TMC) was significantly higher if men consumed fruits/nuts (β=+6.9, SE=1.9, p=0.0005) and vegetables (β=+5.4, SE=1.9, p=0.006), whereas consumption of fries was associated with lower TMC (β=-20.2, SE=8.7, p=0.024). Semen volume was also higher if vegetables or fruits/nuts were frequently consumed (β=+0.06, SE=0.03, p=0.03). Similarly, our sperm epigenetic analyses showed opposing associations for healthy versus fast food items. Frequent consumption of fries was related to a higher chance of sperm being methylated at the MEG3-IG CpG4 site (OR=1.073, 95%CI: 1.035-1.112), and high consumption of vegetables was associated with a lower risk of DNA methylation at the NNAT CpG3 site (OR=0.941, 95%CI: 0.914-0.968). These results remained significant after adjusting for multiple testing. We conclude that dietary habits are linked to sperm epigenetic outcomes. If carried into the next generation paternal unhealthy dietary patterns may result in adverse metabolic conditions and increased risk for chronic diseases in offspring.",

        "abstract": "This dataset contains the raw sequencing data files for reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. Abstract: Little is known about the reproductive effects of paternal cannabis exposure. We evaluated associations between cannabis or tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) exposure and altered DNA methylation in sperm from humans and rats, respectively. DNA methylation, measured by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, differed in the sperm of human users from non-users by at least 10% at 3,979 CpG sites. Pathway analyses indicated Hippo Signaling and Pathways in Cancer as enriched with altered genes (Bonferroni p < 0.02). These same two pathways were also enriched with genes having altered methylation in sperm from THC-exposed versus vehicle-exposed rats (p < 0.01). Data validity is supported by significant correlations between THC exposure levels in humans and methylation for 177 genes, and substantial overlap in THC target genes in rat sperm (this study) and genes previously reported as having altered methylation in the brain of rat offspring born to parents both exposed to THC during adolescence. In humans, cannabis use was also associated with significantly lower sperm concentration. Findings point to possible pre-conception paternal reproductive risks associated with cannabis use.",

The identification of a novel human mitochondrial progesterone receptor (PR-M) that increases cellular respiration brings into question a role for progesterone in oocyte and preimplantation embryo development. Oocytes and embryos were generated from three Rhesus non-human primates (Macaca mulatta) undergoing in vitro fertilization. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for the progesterone receptor and mitochondria, RT-PCR with product sequencing for a mitochondrial progesterone receptor, and mitochondrial membrane determination with JC-1 staining were performed. IHC staining with selective antibodies to the progesterone receptor showed non-nuclear staining. Staining was absent in mouse control embryos. RT-PCR with product sequencing demonstrated PR-M transcript in Rhesus oocytes and embryos, which was absent in mouse embryos. Treatment of Rhesus oocytes and embryos with progesterone showed increased mitochondrial membrane potential, which was absent in mouse embryos. Our results support that progesterone increases mitochondrial membrane potential in oocytes and developing embryos. This is likely an in vivo mechanism to support preimplantation embryo development, and brings up the possibility of in vitro manipulation of culture media for optimization of growth.",

DESIGN: A questionnaire composed by the Society for REI (SREI) board members was e-mailed to members. PubMed was queried to quantify peer-reviewed publications. SETTING: An internal SREI questionnaire to members and online publication search. PATIENT(S): Not applicable. INTERVENTION(S): Questions involving research being performed, funding, relevance to fellow thesis, and important areas of future research. Publications were ascertained in the past 3 years, past 10 years, and total publications for SREI members. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Question responses and number of peer-reviewed publications. RESULT(S): Most respondents currently conduct research, which was predominantly clinical. One-third have current research funding and two-thirds were ever funded. One-third had a National Institutes of Health grant and about half were principal investigators. Two-thirds had a basic science fellow thesis and 44% of respondents perform research related to their fellowship thesis. Important research areas included infertility outcomes, implantation, preimplantation genetic testing, and genetics. In the past 3 years, SREI members published 3,408 peer-reviewed articles (mean ± standard deviation [SD], 4.4 ± 9.0). In the past 10 years, SREI members had 10,162 peer-reviewed publications (mean±SD, 13.0 ± 24.3). When all publications were considered, SREI members published 24,088 peer-reviewed articles (mean±SD, 30.9 ± 53.0). CONCLUSION(S): The REI fellows have learned to construct scientific articles, which will help them to better interpret the literature in the care of patients. The SREI members continue to pursue scientific investigation, commonly related to their fellowship thesis. Respondents support SREI funding research; the success of which should be judged by publications. Overall, SREI members have demonstrated significant academic productivity and published about 1,000 articles/year for the past 10 years, affirming the importance of research training.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to review the role of hormone therapy in menopausal patients with breast cancer and gynecologic malignancies. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed) using a combination of keywords and database-specific subject headings for the following concepts: menopause, hormone therapy, and cancer. Editorials, letters, case reports, and comments were excluded, as were non-English articles. Additional references were identified by hand-searching bibliographies of included articles. The searches yielded a total of 1,484 citations. All citations were imported into EndNote X9, where they were screened by the authors. RESULTS: In breast cancer survivors, systemic hormone therapy is not recommended, whereas local low-dose estrogen therapy may be considered after discussion with the patient's oncologist. Among endometrial cancer survivors, hormone therapy is considered safe in low-risk cancers but should be avoided in high-risk subtypes. For survivors of epithelial ovarian cancer and cervical cancer, hormone therapy can be considered, but should be avoided in women with estrogen-sensitive histologic subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: The risks of hormone therapy should be assessed on an individual basis, with consideration of age, type of hormone therapy, dose, duration of use, regimen, route, and prior exposure. Systemic hormone therapy is not recommended in breast cancer survivors, whereas vaginal low-dose estrogen appears safe. Hormone therapy may be used by endometrial, cervical, and ovarian cancer survivors with low-risk, non-estrogen-receptor-positive subtypes. Video Summary: http://links.lww.com/MENO/A516.",

        "abstract": "Progesterone is primarily a pregnancy-related hormone, produced in substantial quantities after ovulation and during gestation. Traditionally known to function via nuclear receptors for transcriptional regulation, there is also evidence of nonnuclear action. A previously identified mitochondrial progesterone receptor (PR-M) increases cellular respiration in cell models. In these studies, we demonstrated that expression of PR-M in rat H9c2 cardiomyocytes resulted in a ligand-dependent increase in oxidative cellular respiration and beta-oxidation. Cardiac expression in a TET-On transgenic mouse resulted in gene expression of myofibril proteins for remodeling and proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism. In a model of increased afterload from constant transverse aortic constriction, mice expressing PR-M showed a ligand-dependent preservation of cardiac function. From these observations, we propose that PR-M is responsible for progesterone-induced increases in cellular energy production and cardiac remodeling to meet the physiological demands of pregnancy.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Uterine leiomyomas (fibroid tumors) cause considerable symptoms in 30-50% of women and are the leading cause of hysterectomy in the United States. Women with uterine fibroid tumors often seek uterine-preserving treatments, but comparative effectiveness trials are lacking. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to report treatment effectiveness and ovarian function after uterine artery embolization vs magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery from the Fibroid Interventions: Reducing Symptoms Today and Tomorrow study. STUDY DESIGN: The Fibroid Interventions: Reducing Symptoms Today and Tomorrow study, which is a randomized controlled trial of uterine artery embolization vs magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery, enrolled premenopausal women with symptomatic uterine fibroid tumors; women who declined randomization were enrolled in a parallel observational cohort. A comprehensive cohort design was used for outcomes analysis. Our target enrollment was 220 women, of which we achieved 41% (n=91) in the randomized and parallel arms of the trial. Primary outcome was reintervention for uterine fibroid tumors within 36 months. Secondary outcomes were change in serum anti-Müllerian hormone levels and standardized measures of fibroid symptoms, quality of life, pain, and sexual function. RESULTS: From 2010-2014, 83 women (mean age, 44.4 years) were treated in the comprehensive cohort design (43 for magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery [27 randomized]; 40 for uterine artery embolization [22 randomized]); baseline clinical and uterine characteristics were similar between treatment arms, except for higher fibroid load in the uterine artery embolization arm. The risk of reintervention was higher with magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery than uterine artery embolization (hazard ratio, 2.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-7.79). Uterine artery embolization showed a significantly greater absolute decrease in anti-Müllerian hormone levels at 24 months compared with magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery. Quality of life and pain scores improved in both arms but to a greater extent in the uterine artery embolization arm. Higher pretreatment anti-Müllerian hormone level and younger age at treatment increased the overall risk of reintervention. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates a lower reintervention rate and greater improvement in symptoms after uterine artery embolization, although some of the effectiveness may come through impairment of ovarian reserve. Both pretreatment anti-Müllerian hormone level and age are associated with risk of reintervention. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00995878, clinicaltrials.gov.",

        "abstract": "Little is known about the reproductive effects of paternal cannabis exposure. We evaluated associations between cannabis or tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) exposure and altered DNA methylation in sperm from humans and rats, respectively. DNA methylation, measured by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, differed in the sperm of human users from non-users by at least 10% at 3,979 CpG sites. Pathway analyses indicated Hippo Signaling and Pathways in Cancer as enriched with altered genes (Bonferroni p < 0.02). These same two pathways were also enriched with genes having altered methylation in sperm from THC-exposed versus vehicle-exposed rats (p < 0.01). Data validity is supported by significant correlations between THC exposure levels in humans and methylation for 177 genes, and substantial overlap in THC target genes in rat sperm (this study) and genes previously reported as having altered methylation in the brain of rat offspring born to parents both exposed to THC during adolescence. In humans, cannabis use was also associated with significantly lower sperm concentration. Findings point to possible pre-conception paternal reproductive risks associated with cannabis use.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Uterine fibroids are a common problem for reproductive-aged women, yet little comparative effectiveness research is available to guide treatment choice. Uterine artery embolization and magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery are minimally invasive therapies approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating symptomatic uterine fibroids. The Fibroid Interventions: Reducing Symptoms Today and Tomorrow study is the first randomized controlled trial to compare these 2 fibroid treatments. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to summarize treatment parameters and compare recovery trajectory and adverse events in the first 6 weeks after treatment. STUDY DESIGN: Premenopausal women with symptomatic uterine fibroids seen at 3 US academic medical centers were enrolled in the randomized controlled trial (n = 57). Women meeting identical criteria who declined randomization but agreed to study participation were enrolled in a nonrandomized parallel cohort (n = 34). The 2 treatment groups were analyzed by using a comprehensive cohort design. All women undergoing focused ultrasound and uterine artery embolization received the same postprocedure prescriptions, instructions, and symptom diaries for comparison of recovery in the first 6 weeks. Return to work and normal activities, medication use, symptoms, and adverse events were captured with postprocedure diaries. Data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test or χ2 test. Multivariable regression was used to adjust for baseline pain levels and fibroid load when comparing opioid medication, adverse events, and recovery time between treatment groups because these factors varied at baseline between groups and could affect outcomes. Adverse events were also collected. RESULTS: Of 83 women in the comprehensive cohort design who underwent treatment, 75 completed postprocedure diaries. Focused ultrasound surgery was a longer procedure than embolization (mean [SD], 405 [146] vs 139 [44] min; P <.001). Of women undergoing focused ultrasound (n = 43), 23 (53%) underwent 2 treatment days. Immediate self-rated postprocedure pain was higher after uterine artery embolization than focused ultrasound (median [interquartile range], 5 [1-7] vs 1 [1-4]; P = .002). Compared with those having focused ultrasound (n = 39), women undergoing embolization (n = 36) were more likely to use outpatient opioid (75% vs 21%; P < .001) and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications (97% vs 67%; P < .001) and to have a longer median (interquartile range) recovery time (days off work, 8 [6-14] vs 4 [2-7]; P < .001; days until return to normal, 15 [10-29] vs 10 [10-15]; P = .02). There were no significant differences in the incidence or severity of adverse events between treatment arms; 86% of adverse events (42 of 49) required only observation or nominal treatment, and no events caused permanent sequelae or death. After adjustment for baseline pain and uterine fibroid load, uterine artery embolization was still significantly associated with higher opioid use and longer time to return to work and normal activities (P < .001 for each). Results were similar when restricted to the randomized controlled trial. CONCLUSION: Women undergoing uterine artery embolization have longer recovery times and use more prescription medications, but women undergoing focused ultrasound have longer treatment times. These findings were independent of baseline pain levels and fibroid load.",

Numerous studies investigating biomarkers (i.e., urinary metabolites) demonstrate ubiquitous human exposure and suggest that human exposure may be increasing. To formally assess temporal trends, we combined data from 14 U.S. epidemiologic studies for which our laboratory group previously assessed exposure to two commonly used organophosphate compounds, tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) and triphenyl phosphate (TPHP). Using individual-level data and samples collected between 2002 and 2015, we assessed temporal and seasonal trends in urinary bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCIPP) and diphenyl phosphate (DPHP), the metabolites of TDCIPP and TPHP, respectively. Data suggest that BDCIPP concentrations have increased dramatically since 2002. Samples collected in 2014 and 2015 had BDCIPP concentrations that were more than 15 times higher than those collected in 2002 and 2003 (10β = 16.5; 95% confidence interval from 9.64 to 28.3). Our results also demonstrate significant increases in DPHP levels; however, increases were much smaller than for BDCIPP. Additionally, results suggest that exposure varies seasonally, with significantly higher levels of exposure in summer for both TDCIPP and TPHP. Given these increases, more research is needed to determine whether the levels of exposure experienced by the general population are related to adverse health outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that early exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals has long-term consequences that can influence disease risk in offspring. During gametogenesis, imprinted genes are reasonable epigenetic targets with the ability to retain and transfer environmental messages. We hypothesized that exposures to organophosphate (OP) flame-retardants can alter DNA methylation in human sperm cells affecting offspring's health. Sperm and urine samples were collected from 67 men in North Carolina, USA. Urinary metabolites of a chlorinated OP, tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate, and two non-chlorinated OPs, triphenyl phosphate and mono-isopropylphenyl diphenyl phosphate, were measured using liquid-chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry. Sperm DNA methylation at multiple CpG sites of the regulatory differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of imprinted genes GRB10, H19, IGF2, MEG3, NDN, NNAT, PEG1/MEST, PEG3, PLAGL1, SNRPN, and SGCE/PEG10 was quantified using bisulfite pyrosequencing. Regression models were used to determine potential associations between OP concentrations and DNA methylation. We found that men with higher concentrations of urinary OP metabolites, known to originate from flame-retardants, have a slightly higher fraction of sperm cells that are aberrantly methylated. After adjusting for age, obesity-status and multiple testing, exposure to mono-isopropylphenyl diphenyl phosphate was significantly related to hypermethylation at the MEG3, NDN, SNRPN DMRs. Exposure to triphenyl phosphate was associated with hypermethylation at the GRB10 DMR; and tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate exposure was associated with altered methylation at the MEG3 and H19 DMRs. Although measured methylation differences were small, implications for public health can be substantial. Interestingly, our data indicated that a multiplicity of OPs in the human body is associated with increased DNA methylation aberrancies in sperm, compared to exposure to few OPs. Further research is required in larger study populations to determine if our findings can be generalized.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Uterine fibroids are an important source of morbidity for reproductive-aged women. Despite an increasing number of alternatives, hysterectomies account for about 75% of all fibroid interventional treatments. Evidence is lacking to help women and their health care providers decide among alternatives to hysterectomy. Fibroid Interventions: Reducing Symptoms Today and Tomorrow (NCT00995878, clinicaltrials.gov) is a randomized controlled trial to compare the safety, efficacy, and economics of 2 minimally invasive alternatives to hysterectomy: uterine artery embolization and magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery. Although randomized trials provide the highest level of evidence, they have been difficult to conduct in the United States for interventional fibroid treatments. Thus, contemporaneously recruiting women declining randomization may have value as an alternative strategy for comparative effectiveness research. OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare baseline characteristics of randomized participants with nonrandomized participants meeting the same enrollment criteria and to determine whether combining the 2 cohorts in a comprehensive cohort design would be useful for analysis. STUDY DESIGN: Premenopausal women with symptomatic uterine fibroids seeking interventional therapy at 3 US academic medical centers were randomized (1:1) in 2 strata based on calculated uterine volume (<700 and ≥700 cc(3)) to undergo embolization or focused ultrasound surgery. Women who met the same inclusion criteria but declined randomization were offered enrollment in a parallel cohort. Both cohorts were followed up for a maximum of 36 months after treatment. The measures addressed in this report were baseline demographics, symptoms, fibroid and uterine characteristics, and scores on validated quality-of-life measures. RESULTS: Of 723 women screened, 57 were randomized and 49 underwent treatment (27 with focused ultrasound and 22 with embolization). Seven of the 8 women randomized but not treated were assigned to embolization. Of 34 women in the parallel cohort, 16 elected focused ultrasound and 18 elected embolization. Compared with nonrandomized participants, randomized participants had higher mean body mass index (28.7 vs 25.3 kg/m(2); P = .01) and were more likely to be gravid (77% vs 47%; P = .003) and smokers (42% vs 12%; P = .003). Age, race, uterine volume, number of fibroids, and baseline validated measures of general and disease-specific quality of life, pain, depression, and sexual function did not differ between the groups. When we performed a comprehensive cohort analysis and analyzed by treatment arm, the only baseline difference observed was a higher median McGill Pain Score among women undergoing focused ultrasound (10.5 vs 6; P = .03); a similar but nonsignificant trend was seen in visual analog scale scores for pain (median, 39.0 vs 24.0; P = .06). CONCLUSION: Using a comprehensive cohort analysis of study data could result in additional power and greater generalizability if results are adjusted for baseline differences.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To identify the current and future state of the practice of reproductive medicine. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Not applicable. PATIENT(S): None. INTERVENTION(S): Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The survey included 57 questions designed to assess practice patterns/metrics and professional satisfaction and morale. RESULT(S): A total of 336/1,100 (31%) responded, and they were 38% women, 61% men, and 76% Caucasian, with a mean age of 54. Respondents averaged 2.3 jobs and averaged 53 hours of work per week: 44% work in academia and 50% in private groups. Average practice size was 5.5, with an average of 470 fresh IVF cycles performed per year. Percent effort included 63% infertility, 10% endocrinology, 10% surgery, and 9% research. Respondents performed an average of 13 major surgeries, 69 minor surgeries, and 128 oocyte retrievals per year. A total of 60% were salaried, and 40% were equity partners. Compensation was highly skewed. Greater than 84% had a positive morale and had a positive view of the future, and 92% would again choose REI as a career. The most satisfying areas of employment were patient interactions, intellectual stimulation, interactions with colleagues, and work schedule. The least satisfying areas were work schedule and financial compensation. Training was felt to be too focused on female factor infertility and basic research with insufficient training on embryology, genetics, male factor infertility, and clinical research. In the next 5 years, 57% suggested that the need for specialists would stay the same, while 20% predicted a decrease. A total of 58% felt we are training the correct number of fellows (37% felt we are training a surplus). Compared with academia, those in private practice reported higher compensation, less major surgery, more IVF, less endocrinology, and less research. Men worked more hours, conducted more surgery and IVF cycles, and had higher compensation than women. Morale was similar across age, gender, practice type, and geography. CONCLUSION(S): Our subspecialty has an extremely high morale. We are a middle-aged subspecialty with disparate compensation and a focused practice. Some respondents sense a need for a change in our training, and most anticipate only mild growth in our field.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study examines the effect of a progestogen (depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate, DMPA) on resting metabolic rate (RMR) in a cohort of young, normal-weight healthy women. We hypothesize an increase in RMR and nonshivering thermogenesis (NST) resulting in increased body temperature by DMPA. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a prospective cohort study in 13 subjects tested at baseline, 3 weeks and 9 weeks after 150 mg intramuscular DMPA administration. RMR was determined with indirect calorimetry. Secondary endpoints included changes in body mass index (BMI), body composition, temperature and serum levels of estradiol (E2), luteinizing hormone (LH), progesterone and MPA. RESULTS: The percent change in RMR from baseline to week 3 (9%) was significantly higher than the percent change from baseline to week 9 (1.6%) (p=.045). The greatest percent change from baseline to week 3 compared to baseline to week 9 was seen in women initiating DMPA in the luteal phase of the cycle. Hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis was evident by decreases in E2, LH and progesterone. DMPA resulted in increased body temperature with a significant correlation between the change in body temperature and the change in RMR. No change in body composition was seen. CONCLUSIONS: RMR and NST increased in young healthy women with normal BMI 3 weeks after receiving the initial dose of 150 mg DMPA for contraception. The effect was augmented when the drug was administered during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. IMPLICATION: DMPA increases RMR and thermogenesis independent of changes in body mass. An increase in weight with chronic DMPA may result from a combination of hyperphagia and abnormal NST in predisposed individuals.",

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study in the setting of an academic re-productive medicine practice. Records from 162 fresh, autologous, GnRH antagonist ICSI cycles performed between 2009 and 2012 were analyzed. The main outcome measures were rates of clinical pregnancy (CPR), ongoing pregnancy (OPR), and live birth (LBR). RESULTS: For the primary analysis, 4 groups were created based on peak E2/mature oocyte ratio (group 1: <200, group 2: 200–300, group 3: 300–400, and group 4: >400 pg/mL/oocyte). After adjusting for age, basal FSH, and the number of mature oocytes, a significantly lower OPR was seen in group 4 as compared to group 1 (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03–0.86; p=0.032) and group 3 (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.03–0.98; p=0.048), respectively. The adjusted LBR was also significantly lower in group 4 as compared to group 1 (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03–0.83; p=0.030). In a secondary analysis, 3 ranges of peak E2/ mature oocyte ratio (<200, 200–400, and >400 pg/ mL/oocyte) were compared between low, normal, and high responders (<6, 6–15, and >15 mature oocytes, respectively). Clinical pregnancy rate, OPR, and LBR were all lower in normal responders when the E2/oocyte ratio exceeded 400 pg/mL/oocyte as compared to <200 pg/mL/oocyte and 200–300 pg/mL/oocyte (CPR 1% vs. 16% and 32%, respectively, p=0.017; OPR 0 vs. 15% and 27%, respectively, p=0.011; and LBR 0 vs. 13% and 26%, respectively, p=0.018).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epigenetic reprogramming in mammalian gametes resets methylation marks that regulate monoallelic expression of imprinted genes. In males, this involves erasure of the maternal methylation marks and establishment of paternal-specific methylation to appropriately guide normal development. The degree to which exogenous factors influence the fidelity of methylation reprogramming is unknown. We previously found an association between paternal obesity and altered DNA methylation in umbilical cord blood, suggesting that the father's endocrine, nutritional, or lifestyle status could potentiate intergenerational heritable epigenetic abnormalities. In these analyses, we examine the relationship between male overweight/obesity and DNA methylation status of imprinted gene regulatory regions in the gametes. METHODS: Linear regression models were used to compare sperm DNA methylation percentages, quantified by bisulfite pyrosequencing, at 12 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) from 23 overweight/obese and 44 normal weight men. Our study population included 69 volunteers from The Influence of the Environment on Gametic Epigenetic Reprogramming (TIEGER) study, based in NC, USA. RESULTS: After adjusting for age and fertility patient status, semen from overweight or obese men had significantly lower methylation percentages at the MEG3 (β = -1.99; SE = 0.84; p = 0.02), NDN (β = -1.10; SE = 0.47; p = 0.02), SNRPN (β = -0.65; SE = 0.27; p = 0.02), and SGCE/PEG10 (β = -2.5; SE = 1.01; p = 0.01) DMRs. Our data further suggest a slight increase in DNA methylation at the MEG3-IG DMR (β = +1.22; SE = 0.59; p = 0.04) and H19 DMR (β = +1.37; SE = 0.62; p = 0.03) in sperm of overweight/obese men. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support that male overweight/obesity status is traceable in the sperm epigenome. Further research is needed to understand the effect of such changes and the point of origin of DNA methylation differences between lean and overweight/obese men. Together with our earlier reports on paternal obesity and epigenetic shifts in the offspring, our studies set the groundwork for future studies investigating male gametic methylation aberrations due to paternal lifestyle factors such as obesity.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate parameters predictive of pregnancy outcomes in high responders undergoing fresh, autologous, GnRH antagonist IVF/ICSI cycles using a GnRH agonist trigger. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of all patients deemed high-risk for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome who underwent fresh, autologous IVF/ICSI using a GnRH agonist trigger at an academic fertility center from 2010–2012. RESULTS: A total of 71 first cycles were analyzed. Rates of clinical pregnancy, live birth (LB), and total (clinical plus biochemical) miscarriage (MC) were 52%, 38%, and 25%, respectively. Mean peak estradiol (E2) and the number of oocytes retrieved were 3,701 pg/mL and 15.2, respectively. Peak E2 was significantly higher in those cycles resulting in clinical MC (p=0.003). After adjusting for age, basal follicle stimulating hormone, and the number of oocytes retrieved, elevated peak E2 remained associated with increased clinical MC (p=0.029) and trended towards a relationship with higher total MC (p=0.062). When peak E2 was treated as a binary variable based on the threshold value of >5,000 pg/mL, peak E2 above this value was associated with a higher rate of clinical MC (OR=16.14 with 95% CI 1.25–209.35, p=0.033) and total MC (OR=6.81 with 95% CI 1.12–41.54, p=0.037), as well as a lower LB rate (OR= 0.095 with 95% CI 0.01–0.90, p=0.041). CONCLUSION: Clinicians should recognize most IVF/ICSI patients triggered with a GnRH agonist as inherently in danger of excessively high serum E2 and avoid peak levels >5,000 pg/mL in order to avoid higher MC and lower LB rates.",

        "abstract": "Historically, progesterone functions to regulate gene expression via two nuclear progesterone receptors (PR-B and PR-A). Yet, actions of progesterone independent of gene regulation have been observed for decades. These are based on progesterone induced cellular events that occur too rapidly to involve gene transcription or in cells lacking active gene transcription such as mature spermatozoa. Understanding of these \"nongenomic\" effects has been slowed by the lack of identification of specific receptors. Previous discovery of a mitochondrial progesterone receptor, PR-M, has opened up the possibility of direct, ligand-dependent modulation of mitochondrial activity. In this article, we review the current knowledge of PR-M and speculate on possible physiologic and pathophysiologic actions.",

        "abstract": "Ovarian endometriomas are a common manifestation of endometriosis that can represent a more severe stage of the disease. There is much debate over the treatment of these cysts in infertile women, particularly before use of assisted reproductive technologies. Evidence exists that supports surgical excision of ovarian endometriomas, as well as evidence that cautions against surgical intervention. Certain factors need to be examined closely before proceeding with surgery or continuing with expectant management. These include the patient's symptoms, age, ovarian reserve, size and laterality of the cyst, prior surgical treatment, and level of suspicion for malignancy. The most recent evidence appears to suggest that certain patient profiles may benefit from proceeding directly to in vitro fertilization (IVF). These include symptomatic infertile patients, especially those that are older, those that have diminished ovarian reserve, those that have bilateral endometriomas, or those that have had prior surgical treatment. Although endometriomas can be detrimental to the ovarian reserve, surgical therapy may further lower a woman's ovarian reserve. Nevertheless, the presence of an endometrioma does not appear to adversely affect IVF outcomes, and surgical excision of endometriomas does not appear to improve IVF outcomes. Regardless of treatment plan, infertile patients with endometriomas must be counseled appropriately before choosing either treatment path.",

        "abstract": "The hyperactivation of human spermatozoa necessary for fertilization requires a substantial increase in cellular energy production. The factors responsible for increasing cellular energy remain poorly defined. This article proposes a role for a novel mitochondrial progesterone receptor (PR-M) in modulation of mitochondrial activity. Basic science studies demonstrate a 38 kDa protein with western blot analysis, consistent with PR-M; whereas imaging studies with confocal and immunoelectron microscopy demonstrate a PR on the mitochondria. Treatment with a PR-specific progestin shows increased mitochondrial membrane potential, not related to induction of an acrosome reaction. The increase in mitochondrial membrane potential was inhibited by a specific PR antagonist, but not affected by an inhibitor to the progesterone-dependent Catsper voltage-activated channel. In conclusion, these studies suggest expression of a novel mitochondrial PR in human spermatozoa with a progestin-dependent increase in mitochondrial activity. This mechanism may serve to enhance cellular energy production as the spermatozoa traverse the female genital tract being exposed to increasing concentrations of progesterone.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between oocyte number and the rates of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and live birth (LB) in fresh autologous in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: An academic reproductive medicine practice. PATIENT(S): We analyzed data from 256,381 IVF cycles using the 2008-2010 Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology national registry. Patients were divided into five groups based on retrieved oocyte number. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Rates of OHSS and LB were calculated for each group. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used to assess differences in OHSS and LB between groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate oocyte number as a predictor of OHSS and LB. INTERVENTION(S): None. RESULT(S): The LB rate increased up to 15 oocytes, then plateaued (0-5: 17%, 6-10: 31.7%; 11-15: 39.3%; 16-20: 42.7%; 21-25: 43.8%; and >25 oocytes: 41.8%). However, the rate of OHSS became much more clinically significant after 15 oocytes (0-5: 0.09%; 6-10: 0.37%; 11-15: 0.93%; 16-20: 1.67%; 21-25: 3.03%; and >25 oocytes: 6.34%). These trends remained after adjustment with the use of GEE. ROC curves revealed that although oocyte number is not useful in the prediction of LB, 15 retrieved oocytes is the number that best predicts OHSS risk. CONCLUSION(S): Retrieval of >15 oocytes significantly increases OHSS risk without improving LB rate in fresh autologous IVF cycles. In general, less aggressive stimulation protocols should be considered, especially in high-responders, to optimize outcomes.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Clinical evidence supports a role for progestins in the growth of leiomyomata (fibroids). The mechanism(s) for this is thought to involve gene regulation via the nuclear progesterone receptors. Recently a mitochondrial progesterone receptor (PR-M) has been identified with evidence of a progesterone/progestin-dependent increase in cellular respiration. This observation raises a possible new mechanism whereby progesterone/progestin may affect the growth of fibroids. OBJECTIVE: The goals of this research were to determine differential expression of PR-M in normal myometrium compared with the edge of a fibroid within the same uterus, to demonstrate a progestin-dependent increase in mitochondria membrane potential using an immortalized human myometrial cell line and to examine mitochondrial membrane potential in transfected cells expressing the complete coding sequence of PR-M. DESIGN: Protein levels of PR-M, PR-B, PR-A, mitochondrial porin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were determined in the myometrium and adjacent edge of a fibroid in 10 subjects undergoing hysterectomy for benign indications. Mitochondrial membrane potential was determined by fluorescent emission of 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolecarbocyanide iodine in hTERT-HM cells treated with R5020 and in transfected hTERT-HM cells determined by the fluorescent emission of tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester. RESULTS: Higher levels of PR-M and mitochondrial porin were found in the fibroid edge compared with adjacent myometrium. Progestin increased mitochondrial membrane potential in hTERT-HM cells, which was not affected by a translation inhibitor. This effect was exaggerated in hTERT-HM cells expressing PR-M after transient transfection. CONCLUSION: These studies suggest a mechanism whereby progesterone/progestin may affect the growth of fibroids by altering mitochondrial activity.",

        "abstract": "The cDNA for a novel truncated progesterone receptor (PR-M) was previously cloned from human adipose and aortic cDNA libraries. The predicted protein sequence contains 16 unique N-terminal amino acids, encoded by a sequence in the distal third intron of the progesterone receptor PR gene, followed by the same amino acid sequence encoded by exons 4 through 8 of the nuclear PR. Thus, PR-M lacks the N terminus A/B domains and the C domain for DNA binding, whereas containing the hinge and hormone-binding domains. In this report, we have localized PR-M to mitochondria using immunofluorescent localization of a PR-M-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein and in Western blot analyses of purified human heart mitochondrial protein. Removal of the putative N-terminal mitochondrial localization signal obviated association of PR-M with mitochondria, whereas addition of the mitochondrial localization signal to green fluorescent protein resulted in mitochondrial localization. Immunoelectron microscopy and Western blot analysis after mitochondrial fractionation identified PR-M in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Antibody specificity was shown by mass spectrometry identification of a PR peptide in a mitochondrial membrane protein isolation. Cell models of overexpression and gene silencing of PR-M demonstrated a progestin-induced increase in mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in oxygen consumption consistent with an increase in cellular respiration. This is the first example of a truncated steroid receptor, lacking a DNA-binding domain that localizes to the mitochondrion and initiates direct non-nuclear progesterone action. We hypothesize that progesterone may directly affect cellular energy production to meet the increased metabolic demands of pregnancy.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Trophoblast-derived human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) promotes corpus luteum progesterone (P4) production, and wide ranges of serum P4 levels are noted in various pregnancy outcomes, despite similar hCG concentrations. There are five unique biologically active hCG variants in human pregnancy urine, and previous studies of P4 production in response to hCG have used only preparations containing all isoforms. Understanding exactly which hCG variant is primarily responsible for stimulating corpus luteum steroidogenesis may have great clinical and diagnostic implications, including in the setting of ectopic pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to delineate the role of the standard and hyperglycosylated (H)-hCG isoforms in stimulating P4 production by luteinized granulosa cells. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cell culture, ELISA, and fluorometric-based protein assays were done at Duke University Medical Center. PATIENTS: Patients were anonymous oocyte donors. INTERVENTION: Cultured luteinized granulosa cells were treated with 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 ng/ml total hCG, which contains all isoforms, purified standard hCG (37.1 kDa), and purified H-hCG (42.8 kDa). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: P4 produced per total cellular protein (nanograms per microgram) was measured via ELISA and fluorometric protein determination kits. RESULTS: Both total hCG (P = 0.0003) and purified standard hCG (P < 0.0001) stimulated a dose-dependent increase in P4 production. Purified H-hCG did not change the P4 produced per total cellular protein response (P value not significant). CONCLUSIONS: Standard hCG stimulated P4 production by cultured granulosa cells and likely supports corpus luteum function via interactions with the LH/hCG receptor. In contrast, H-hCG did not increase P4 production, which indicates a nonsteroidogenic role for this protein during early gestation.",

Bleeding manifestations of this disorder are varied and poorly correlate with factor XI levels. Spontaneous bleeding is uncommon, whereas delayed postoperative bleeding is often the presentation of factor XI deficiency. To date, there are no standard recommendations for prophylactic treatment in women undergoing gynecologic surgery. Here, we review published cases of gynecological surgery in women with factor XI deficiency and discuss the risks and benefits of various therapeutic options. TARGET AUDIENCE: Obstetricians And Gynecologists. LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After participating in this activity, physicians should be better able to identify the pathophysiology of factor XI deficiency. Compare previous outcomes of prophylactic treatment in patients with factor XI deficiency undergoing gynecological surgery. Implement possible prophylactic therapies for patients with factor XI deficiency undergoing gynecological surgery.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Progesterone is produced by the corpus luteum until completion of the luteal-placental shift at approximately 6-10 weeks following last menstruation. Studies have shown that first trimester progesterone levels are predictive of pregnancy viability, and some authors support a level of 5 ng/mL as an absolute threshold to indicate viability. CASE: A 47-year-old woman with recurrent pregnancy loss was noted to have a very low first trimester progesterone level (1.2 ng/mL), but the pregnancy progressed to viability. She unfortunately delivered an intrauterine fetal demise at 27 weeks and 3 days' gestation. CONCLUSION: A single serum progesterone level of < 5 ng/mL is suggestive, but not diagnostic, of a nonviable pregnancy. Routine uterine curettage during the evaluation of a pregnancy of unknown location using this level as an absolute cutoff may result in the interruption of a desired, viable pregnancy.",

        "abstract": "Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are stable epigenetic features within or in proximity to imprinted genes. We used this feature to identify candidate human imprinted loci by quantitative DNA methylation analysis. We discovered a unique DMR at the 5'-end of FAM50B at 6p25.2. We determined that sense transcripts originating from the FAM50B locus are expressed from the paternal allele in all human tissues investigated except for ovary, in which expression is biallelic. Furthermore, an antisense transcript, FAM50B-AS, was identified to be monoallelically expressed from the paternal allele in a variety of tissues. Comparative phylogenetic analysis showed that FAM50B orthologs are absent in chicken and platypus, but are present and biallelically expressed in opossum and mouse. These findings indicate that FAM50B originated in Therians after divergence from Prototherians via retrotransposition of a gene on the X chromosome. Moreover, our data are consistent with acquisition of imprinting during Eutherian evolution after divergence of Glires from the Euarchonta mammals. FAM50B expression is deregulated in testicular germ cell tumors, and loss of imprinting occurs frequently in testicular seminomas, suggesting an important role for FAM50B in spermatogenesis and tumorigenesis. These results also underscore the importance of accounting for parental origin in understanding the mechanism of 6p25-related diseases.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The truncated mitochondrial progesterone receptor (PR-M) is homologous to nuclear PRs with the exception of an amino terminus hydrophobic membrane localization sequence, which localizes PR-M to mitochondria. Given the matrilineal inheritance of both spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB) and the mitochondrial genome, we hypothesized that (a) PR-M is polymorphic and (b) PR-M localization sequence polymorphisms could result in variable progesterone-mitochondrial effects and variable responsiveness to progesterone prophylaxis. METHODS: Secondary analysis of DNA from women enrolled in a multicenter, prospective, study of 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17OHPC) versus placebo for the prevention of recurrent SPTB. DNA was extracted from stored saliva. RESULTS: The PR-M localization sequence was sequenced on 344 patients. Sequences were compared with the previously published 48 base-pair sequence, and all were identical. CONCLUSIONS: We did not detect genetic variation in the mitochondrial localization sequence of the truncated PR-M in a group of women at high risk for SPTB.",

        "abstract": "Extracellular ATP activates purinergic (P(2)) receptors with an increase in intracellular calcium and phosphorylation of MAPK. In this study we have investigated the effect of progesterone/progestin on ATP-induced calcium mobilization and phosphorylation of the kinase ERK in the T47D-Y breast cancer cell line that exhibits no detectable nuclear progesterone receptor expression. Brief pretreatment with progesterone/progestin results in a dose dependent inhibition of ATP-induced intracellular calcium mobilization, and inhibition of ERK phosphorylation. Response to a cell impermeable ligand and inhibition of the response by an inactivating antibody suggests a mechanism of action at the plasma membrane. These results in T47D-Y cells strongly suggest that progesterone can act in a rapid non-nuclear manner to inhibit extracellular ATP effects on intracellular calcium mobilization and ERK activation. This research provides an example of progesterone action in a breast cancer cell line lacking expression of the classical nuclear progesterone receptors.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bioidentical hormones, including implanted estradiol-17beta pellets, have received considerable interest in the lay media. It is thought that parenteral estrogens have fewer gastrointestinal side effects than oral products. CASE: A 46-year-old woman in surgical menopause was transferred due to persistent abdominal pain and nausea after cholecystectomy in the setting of long-term hyperestrogenemia. She denied recent use of hormone therapy. Significant findings included biliary dyskinesia, hypertriglyceridemia and focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver with fatty infiltration. Laboratory findings were significant for hyperestrogenemia with markedly suppressed gonadotropin levels and undetectable inhibin level. The patient eventually disclosed receiving serial implants of estradiol-17beta and testosterone pellets by another provider. CONCLUSION: Serum levels from hormone pellets are unpredictable and can remain elevated for years. Lack of standardized dosing parameters for this nonregulated product likely contributes to the chance of hyperestrogenemia. Despite bypassing first-pass metabolism, supraphysiologic levels of these hormones can cause significant metabolic and gastrointestinal impairments.",

        "abstract": "The effects of progesterone on breast epithelial cells remain poorly defined with observations showing both proliferative and antiproliferative effects. As an example, progesterone levels correlate with increased epithelial cell proliferation, but there is discordance between the dividing cells and the cells with nuclear progesterone receptor expression. The release of paracrine growth factors from nuclear receptor-positive cells has been postulated as a mechanism, since in vitro studies show a lack of growth effect by progesterone in breast epithelial cells lacking nuclear receptors. This study examined possible nongenomic effects of progesterone in breast epithelia by using MCF-10A cells known to lack nuclear progesterone receptor expression. Treatment for 30-60 min with progesterone or the progestin, R5020, increased mitochondrial activity as shown by an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential (hyperpolarization) with a concordant increase in total cellular ATP. The reaction was inhibited by a specific progesterone receptor antagonist and not affected by the translation inhibitor cycloheximide. Progestin treatment inhibited apoptosis induced by activation of the FasL pathway, as shown by a decrease in sub-G(1) cell fraction during fluorescence-activated cell sorting and a decrease in caspase 3/7 levels. Progestin treatment did not alter the cell cycle over 48 h. Our study demonstrates a nongenomic action of progesterone on benign breast epithelial cells, resulting in enhanced cellular respiration and protection from apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To study evidence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in premenarcheal adolescents with unexplained ovarian torsion. DESIGN: Retrospective observational case series. SETTING: Tertiary university clinical center PARTICIPANTS: Six premenarcheal adolescents and six adults with acute ovarian torsion INTERVENTION: A chart review. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Contralateral ovarian size, operative findings, ovarian pathology, hormone testing RESULTS: Five of the six premenarcheal cases had no pathologic explanation for their ovarian torsion. In four of the cases, size measurements of the contralateral ovary were noted to be larger than the criterion of their respective age group. Three of the four cases had either an ovarian volume (28.5 cm(3)) or an area (16.0 cm(2) and 57.6 cm(2)) that was above the size criterion for a polycystic ovary (volume >10 cm(3) or area>5.5 cm(2)). Pathology of a wedge biopsy of one of the contralateral ovaries suggested evidence of polycystic ovary. Finally, hormone testing available in three of the cases revealed elevated testosterone levels in two. Among the adults, half of the cases had a pathologic explanation for ovarian torsion. One out of the five cases had a contralateral ovary that was significantly enlarged and this was noted in a woman with a diagnosis of PCOS. The remaining two cases had extensive necrosis of the torsed ovary and no other diagnosis was made. CONCLUSION: We propose that premenarcheal girls presenting with ovarian torsion, without obvious ovarian pathology, be screened for ultrasound and biochemical evidence of PCOS. In those with evidence of PCOS, treatment with oral contraceptives should be considered taking into account the age and pubertal development, to decrease ovarian volume.",

PATIENT(S): A 16-year-old girl with epispadias, history of mild urinary incontinence, auditory neuropathy, and functional hyperandrogenism. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Peripheral blood array-based comparative genomic hybridization. RESULT(S): The patient was referred for evaluation of excessive weight gain, secondary amenorrhea, and abnormal external genitalia. Examination under anesthesia revealed bilateral labia minora hypertrophy, bifid clitoris, and a patulous urethra, consistent with female epispadias. Hormonal evaluation showed functional hyperandrogenism, and peripheral blood array-based comparative genomic hybridization showed no chromosomal deletions or duplications. CONCLUSION(S): Female epispadias is a rare abnormality, not commonly recognized by most practitioners. The diagnosis is supported by a history of urinary incontinence and physical findings of bifid clitoris and patulous urethra. The condition can have serious physical and psychological consequences leading to a gross disruption of social function.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We reviewed the evidence regarding the outcomes of interventions used in ovulation induction, superovulation, and in vitro fertilization (IVF) for the treatment of infertility. Short-term outcomes included pregnancy, live birth, multiple gestation, and complications. Long-term outcomes included pregnancy and post-pregnancy complications for both mothers and infants. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and Cochrane Collaboration resources. REVIEW METHODS: We included studies published in English from January 2000 through January 2008. For short-term outcomes, we excluded non-randomized studies and studies where a pregnancy or live birth rate per subject could not be calculated. For long-term outcomes, we excluded studies with fewer than 100 subjects and those without a control group. Articles were abstracted for relevant details, and relative risks or odds ratios, with 95 percent confidence intervals, were calculated for outcomes of interest for each study. RESULTS: We identified 5294 abstracts and (for the three questions discussed in this draft report) reviewed 1210 full-text articles and included 478 articles for abstraction. Approximately 80 percent of the included studies were performed outside the United States. The majority of randomized trials were not designed to detect differences in pregnancy and live birth rates; reporting of delivery rates and obstetric outcomes was unusual. Most did not have sufficient power to detect clinically meaningful differences in live birth rates, and had still lower power to detect differences in less frequent outcomes such as multiple births and complications. Interventions for which there was sufficient evidence to demonstrate improved pregnancy or live birth rates included: (a) administration of clomiphene citrate in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome, (b) metformin plus clomiphene in women who fail to respond to clomiphene alone; (c) ultrasound-guided embryo transfer, and transfer on day 5 post-fertilization, in couples with a good prognosis; and (d) assisted hatching in couples with previous IVF failure. There was insufficient evidence regarding other interventions. Infertility itself is associated with most of the adverse longer-term outcomes. Consistently, infants born after infertility treatments are at risk for complications associated with abnormal implantation or placentation; the degree to which this is due to the underlying infertility, treatment, or both is unclear. Infertility, but not infertility treatment, is associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the large emotional and economic burden resulting from infertility, there is relatively little high-quality evidence to support the choice of specific interventions. Removing barriers to conducting appropriately designed studies should be a major policy goal.",

        "abstract": "In the late 1980s and early 1990s, researchers hypothesized that aspirin could be used to prevent or delay the onset of preeclampsia. This hypothesis was tested in numerous trials which showed limited, but positive results. Subsequently, aspirin has been used in an attempt to improve pregnancy outcomes in women who have both antiphospholipid antibodies and a history of recurrent loss, and has also been used in an attempt to improve the success of in vitro fertilization. In theory, aspirin has both positive and negative effects on reproduction. Aspirin, which suppresses cyclooxygenase, has the potential to interfere with implantation, but also has the potential to support the maintenance of pregnancy. Aspirin is prescribed with increasing frequency to reduce the risk of maternal thrombosis and reduce the risk of miscarriage and poor pregnancy outcome. Aspirin alone, however, is not considered sufficient to prevent thrombosis and even in women with the antiphospholipid syndrome, the question as to whether low-dose aspirin improves pregnancy outcomes has not been answered affirmatively. Aspirin has potential risks. Aspirin inhibits platelet function and can contribute to maternal and fetal bleeding. Aspirin crosses the placenta. Although aspirin has not been associated with other congenital anomalies, it has been associated with an increased risk of vascular disruptions, particularly gastroschisis and possibly premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. Nonetheless, large trials demonstrate low-dose aspirin's relative safety and generally positive effects on reproductive outcomes.",

In this review we provide brief background information regarding mitochondrial structure and function and then focus upon interactions of glucocorticoid, estrogen, androgen, and progesterone receptors with mitochondria. We evaluate the current evidence for steroid receptor localization in the mitochondria based on techniques of Western blot analysis, immunocytochemistry, electron microscopy, and mass spectrometry. Steroid receptor-dependent interactions with mitochondria may include transcriptional regulation of nuclear DNA-encoded mitochondrial proteins, transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins, or indirect effects on mitochondria due to interactions with cytoplasmic signaling peptides and non-genomic control of cation fluxes. These interactions may play a role in mitochondrial-dependent processes of oxidative phosphorylation and apoptosis. Physiological examples of these interactions are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Demasculinization by environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) is observed in many animal species but less evident in humans. Rodent studies with gestational exposure to either the fungicide vinclozolin or the insecticide methoxychlor demonstrate impaired male fertility with abnormal DNA methylation patterns in spermatozoa. Once established, these epigenetic changes may be permanent and thus paternally passed to subsequent generations. Conclusive evidence of a similar phenomenon in humans has not been established, but several observations bring up the possibility. Some, but not all, studies show an increase in male genital abnormalities after prenatal EDC exposure. Other studies demonstrate sperm abnormalities in males with EDC contact, although it is unclear as to whether this is due to prenatal or postnatal exposure. Although not examined in males with EDC exposure, one study shows gamete DNA methylation abnormalities in males with severe oligospermia. A subsequent study failed to corroborate these findings. The use of assisted reproductive techniques including intracytoplasmic sperm injection has removed natural selection barriers thus enabling reproduction in males that would otherwise be sterile. This review explores the hypothesis that prenatal EDC exposure results in transgenerational male reproductive abnormalities propagated by the use of assisted reproductive technologies.",

        "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders seen among reproductive-age women, with a prevalence of 4%-9% depending on the criteria used to define the syndrome. The diagnostic criteria for PCOS have been surprisingly controversial and confusing for patients, clinicians, and researchers. We believe that the confusion surrounding PCOS arises almost entirely because its name refers to a trait that is inconsistently present and irrelevant to both the etiology and the treatment of the disorder. We suggest that merely abandoning the term PCOS will cure much of what has ailed us for decades and allow us to focus on the etiology and treatment of the causes of what the experts in this field have come to recognize as functional female hyperandrogenism.",

        "abstract": "Progesterone is produced by granulosa cells under the influence of luteinizing hormone. Nuclear progesterone receptors have been found in rat granulosa cells. Human granulosa-lutein cells rapidly respond to progesterone with an increase in intracellular calcium suggesting the existence of a nongenomic mechanism. This study was conducted to determine whether binding of progesterone to granulosa cells could occur at the membrane. Granulosa cells were obtained from an in vitro fertilization program and examined immunohistochemically with an antiserum to membrane progesterone receptors. Approximately 14-70% of freshly harvested or cultured granulosa cells of six patients showed a positive reaction to the antiserum, limited to the cell membrane. Western blot analysis of homogenates of granulosa cells and a granulosa cell tumour confirmed the presence of progesterone receptors A, B and C and low amounts of a putative membrane receptor. These results demonstrate that the plasma membranes of human granulosa cells possess binding components for progesterone which may be involved in its nongenomic mechanism of action.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To identify a novel nongenomic progesterone receptor (PR), PR-M, in T47D-Y breast cancer cells lacking genomic PR expression. METHODS: Immunofluorescent staining of T47D and T47D-Y breast cancer cells with selective anti-PR antibodies and ligand binding. Transient transfection of breast cancer cells with a cDNA expressing PR-M with a carboxy terminal green fluorescent protein. RESULTS: In the T47D-Y cell line, lacking expression of genomic PR, plasma membrane-bound and intracellular PR(s) are identified with anti-PR antibodies directed to the hormone-binding domain but not with an antibody directed to the amino terminus. A plasma membrane PR is also evident by immunofluorescent ligand binding. Expression of a novel truncated PR (PR-M) tagged with green fluorescent protein showed intracellular localization. CONCLUSIONS: These studies support the expression of a novel, truncated PR (PR-M) in a breast cancer cell line known to lack expression of genomic PR. This observation raises the possibility of progesterone action in breast cancer cells classically considered nonresponsive due to lack of genomic PR expression.",

DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: Academic human reproduction laboratory. PATIENT(S): One hundred couples undergoing IVF with conventional insemination or ICSI. INTERVENTION(S): Embryo quality was assessed using both pre-embryo pronuclear morphology (zygote scoring or Z-scoring) at the time of fertilization evaluation and standard day 2 and day 3 embryo morphology (number of blastomeres and grading based on degree of fragmentation and blastomere size). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): We tested two decision models, one based on Z-scores and another on morphology, to determine which grading system better predicted pregnancy outcomes in assisted reproductive technique. Zygote score and embryo morphology were measured for all embryos and the transferred embryo pool. Implantation and pregnancy rates resulting from the embryo transfers of all cycles were calculated. RESULT(S): The Z-score distribution of 552 embryos was 27% Z1, 8% Z2, 50% Z3, and 15% Z4. Z1 and Z3 embryos had significantly (P approximately .03) higher quality over Z2 and Z4 embryos. Using the Z-score decision model with Z1 embryos having highest priority for transfer, pregnancy rates were similar between Z1 and Z3 embryos. Using embryo morphology as a decision model, pregnancy rates were highest in transfers containing one or two \"best\"-quality embryos. CONCLUSION(S): Z1 and Z3 embryos had similar morphology and pregnancy rates. The decision model based on the Z-score model was not better than standard embryo morphology in predicting pregnancy outcome.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that couples with sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA) DNA fragmentation index (DFI) values >27% would not achieve pregnancy with assisted reproductive techniques (ART) and to investigate how DFI and high DNA stainability (HDS), as measured by the SCSA, affect fertilization, cleavage, implantation, and pregnancy rates in IVF cycles. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: Academic human reproduction laboratory. PATIENT(S): One hundred couples undergoing IVF with conventional insemination or intracytoplasmic sperm injection. INTERVENTION(S): Testing with SCSA was performed by SCSA Diagnostics (Brookings, South Dakota) on a semen aliquot taken from ejaculate used for ART. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Relating total DFI and HDS to conventional semen parameters and cycle-specific outcomes after ART. RESULT(S): Nine of nineteen couples achieved clinical pregnancy when DFI was > or =27%, and 2 of 22 couples achieved clinical pregnancy when DFI was < or =9%. One of nine couples achieved clinical pregnancy with HDS >17%. The DFI was negatively correlated with sperm density (r = -0.23, P<.03) and motility (r = -0.55, P<.00), and HDS was negatively correlated with sperm density (r = -0.37, P<.00). CONCLUSION(S): Sperm chromatin structure assay failed to identify elevated DFI thresholds for negative pregnancy outcome after ART. Patients with low DFI (< or =9%) were least likely to become pregnant, which is also contradictory to SCSA marketing, which states that DFIs of < or =15% have excellent fertility potential. Patients with HDS > or =17% had low pregnancy rates, indicating decreased fertility potential, which deserves further investigation. Larger studies are necessary to confirm that low DFI is associated with decreased fertility and, if proved, might redefine the use of the SCSA in evaluating infertility.",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Mullerian agenesis, commonly referred to as Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome (MRKHS), is a congenital defect that is most commonly associated with renal and spinal malformations. It is very rare for Mullerian agenesis to be accompanied by malformations of the extremities. In this report, we describe a 22-year-old woman with Mullerian agenesis and thrombocytopenia absent radius syndrome (TARS). We also review rare syndromes associated with Mullerian anomalies, including Mullerian hypoplasia/aplasia-renal agenesis-cervicothoracic somite dysplasia (MURCS), Roberts syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), McKusick-Kaufman syndrome (MKS), Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, and others. The pathogenesis of these complex malformation syndromes is not well understood as a result of their sporadic occurrence. However, some of these syndromes do follow a pattern of inheritance, suggesting that they could provide insights into our understanding of their origins. TARGET AUDIENCE: Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Family Physicians LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After completion of this article, the reader should be able to review the rare congenital defects associated with Mullerian agenesis, to determine the genetic etiologies of the associated syndromes with Mullerian agenesis, and to discuss information for parental counseling related to inheritance patterns and growth and development of the affected child.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of exposure to blood and time from aspiration to incubation on oocyte fertilization. DESIGN: Retrospective, cohort study. SETTING: Hospital-based IVF practice. PATIENT(S): Eighty-two women undergoing IVF procedures. INTERVENTION(S): Patients received a standard gonadotropin protocol or a microdose flare protocol. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURE(S): Logistic regression was used to estimate odds of nonfertilization, adjusting for maternal age, time from aspiration to incubation, presence of blood in the aspirate, and a time-by-blood interaction. Two statistical methods were used: an analysis that assumed oocytes were independent and an analysis that adjusted for the lack of independence of oocytes within mothers (i.e., cluster-correlated data). RESULT(S): The 82 women contributed 1093 oocytes. In a model with blood dicotomized as present or absent, and with time elapsed and maternal age categorized into quartiles, both time and maternal age were statistically significant when conventional logistic regression was used. In analyses that accounted for clustering within mother, retrieval-to-incubation times more than 4 minutes were associated with an increased risk of nonfertilization, but age and blood were not; there was no evidence of an interaction between time elapsed and blood. CONCLUSION(S): If appropriate statistics are applied, retrieval-to-incubation times more than 4 minutes are associated with increased risk of nonfertilization.",

        "abstract": "Observational studies demonstrate that estradiol and progesterone affect vasoreactivity. In animal studies, progesterone treatment causes immediate relaxation of precontracted arteries with inhibition of calcium influx in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, suggesting a non-genomic mechanism of action. In this study we investigated the presence of novel membrane-bound progesterone receptors in human aortic endothelial cells and correlated the expression with cell-cycle stage. Western blotting analysis with an antibody directed to the hormone-binding domain of the classic progesterone receptors shows predominant bands at 100 and 60 kD, whereas analysis with an antibody to the DNA-binding region shows only the 100-kD band. In contrast, classic nuclear progesterone receptors B and A are identified at 116 and 94 kD in similarly processed T47D cells. Both novel bands localize to the membrane fraction after differential centrifugation. Plasma membrane-bound progesterone receptor was further shown with immunofluorescent antibody and ligand-binding studies in a small percentage of human aortic endothelial cells. Fluorescent activated cell sorting demonstrated that approximately 8% of the human aortic endothelial cells expressed a plasma membrane progesterone receptor and that a greater percentage of the expressing cells were in the G2/M-phase of the cell cycle. Treatment with progesterone conjugated to BSA did not show any significant cell-cycle changes. Plasma membrane-bound progesterone receptor in vascular endothelial cells may regulate the non-genomic actions of progesterone, and expression of the receptor appears to vary with cell cycle stage.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Unlike laparoscopic surgery for interval tubal sterilization, a hysteroscopic approach obviates surgical incision and requires only local anaesthesia or intravenous sedation. The safety, tolerability and efficacy of an hysteroscopically placed micro-insert device was evaluated. METHODS: A cohort of 227 previously fertile women participated in this prospective international multicentre trial. Micro-inserts were placed bilaterally into the proximal Fallopian tube lumens under hysteroscopic visualization in outpatient procedures. RESULTS: Successful bilateral micro-insert placement was achieved in 88% of women. The majority of women reported that intraprocedural pain was less than or equal to that expected, and 90% rated tolerance of the device placement procedure as good to excellent. Most women could be discharged in an ambulatory state within 1-2 h. Adverse events occurred in 7% of the women, but none was serious. Correct device placement was confirmed in 97% of cases at 3 months. Over 24 months follow-up, 98% of study participants rated their tolerance of the micro-insert as very good to excellent. After 6015 woman-months of exposure to intercourse, no pregnancies have been recorded.

        "abstract": "Progesterone acts via two specific receptors to affect gene transcription in target tissues. Progesterone receptor (PR) B contains 933 amino acids while PR A is a truncated version lacking the initial 164 amino acids. We have cloned a novel, truncated PR from both human adipose and aortic cDNA libraries. This cDNA encodes a predicted protein of 314 amino acids, termed PR-M. Initiation of transcription of PR-M occurs in intron 3, with the initial exon identical to exon 4 of the genomic PRs, except for a novel 16 amino acid amino-terminal sequence, consistent with a signal peptide. The remainder of PR-M is identical to the genomic PR. Transcript for this protein was identified by RT-PCR in human aortic endothelial cells and T47D breast cancer cells. Expression of PR-M in Sf 9 insect cells results in a 38-kDa protein, demonstrated in human aortic endothelial cells and T47D breast cancer cells. The function of PR-M remains to be determined. The presence of a signal peptide and the lack of a DNA binding region suggests a non-genomic action.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Coronary heart disease (CHD) in women is strongly associated with estrogen deprivation. For example, risk for CHD increases dramatically after menopause. However, the role of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in CHD prevention currently is unresolved. To better understand CHD in women, the precise mechanisms by which estrogen affects circulatory function require clarification. Evidence suggests that exogenous estrogen may affect blood pressure (BP) control, but its interaction with other CHD risk factors has not been systematically characterized. The present study examines the role of mildly elevated resting BP, family history of CHD, and HRT on BP responses to stress in postmenopausal women. METHODS: Postmenopausal women on long-term HRT were recruited along with a control group of postmenopausal women not on HRT. These women were divided into higher versus lower risk for CHD on the basis of resting BP and family history of CHD. BP control mechanisms were assessed before, during, and after a computer-controlled laboratory stressor. RESULTS: Results indicate that women with elevated resting BP and positive family history of CHD have exaggerated BP reactivity to stress and that HRT inhibits this effect. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that unmedicated postmenopausal women with mildly elevated resting BP and positive family history of CHD have altered BP control as indicated by exaggerated BP responses to stress. HRT eliminates the cumulative effect of resting BP and family history on BP reactivity, suggesting that the circulatory effects of estrogen replacement may operate, at least in part, through normalization of BP reactivity in higher-risk postmenopausal women.",

The lack of specific symptoms and the absence of typical herpetic lesions in a majority of cases contribute to delayed diagnosis. CASE: We describe a fatal case of fulminant hepatic failure due to herpes simplex in a healthy woman presenting after laparoscopy and hysteroscopy for tubal infertility. The patient lacked evidence of mucocutaneous lesions or jaundice. The surgery likely contributed to viral dissemination. CONCLUSION: Although rare, disseminated herpes should be considered a possible cause of postsurgical pelvic infections, even in the absence of ulcerative lesions. Until a definitive diagnosis is made, antiviral therapy should be considered in patients with high fever, leukopenia, and abnormal liver function.",

        "abstract": "While the role of dietary fats in breast cancer remains controversial, the recent cloning of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), a nuclear hormone receptor, from human breast cancer cells lines provides a potential molecular link. Several fatty acids from four classes of dietary fats were tested for their ability to mediate the transcriptional activity of PPARgamma in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells using growth media with minimal serum. Whereas omega-3 fatty acids inhibit transactivation of PPARgamma to levels below control, omega-6, monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids stimulate the activity of the transcriptional reporter. These studies indicate that individual fatty acids differentially regulate the transcriptional activity of PPARgamma by selectively acting as agonists or antagonists. Furthermore, the transcriptional activation of PPARgamma correlates with cell proliferation in MCF-7 cells. Understanding the effects of individual fats on breast cancer cells and PPARgamma transactivation could provide important new insights into the epidemiology of breast cancer and the role of dietary fat.",

        "abstract": "Leptin is the product of the ob gene, reported to be secreted exclusively from adipocytes and thought to control satiety by providing information to the central nervous system. However, the function of leptin appears to be more complex because multiple studies demonstrate its role in hematopoiesis, reproduction, and immunity. In addition, several nonadipose sources of leptin have been reported. The purpose of this study was to examine several breast cancer cell lines and ductal carcinomas of the breast for expression of leptin messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein. For tumor studies, specimens were preassayed for contaminating adipose tissue. Northern blot analyses demonstrated leptin mRNA in several breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, T47D, and MDA-MB-231), a normal breast epithelial cell line (MCF10A), and four breast tumors. Leptin protein was identified in T47D breast cancer cells by indirect immunofluorescent staining and in samples of the same breast tumors used for Northern studies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). This preliminary study suggests that leptin is expressed in malignant epithelial cells of the breast. Further investigation is needed to determine whether this protein plays a role in breast carcinogenesis.",

SETTING: Hospital-based IVF facility composed of an anteroom, a cleanroom, and an adjacent operating room. PATIENT(S): Two-hundred seventy-five couples requesting IVF between 1993 and 1997. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Particle counts (sizes 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 microm); IVF rates; and embryo quality (stage and grade). RESULT(S): Clinical pregnancy rates decreased from 35% in 1993 to 16% in 1994 (numerous construction odors were detected during 1994) and increased steadily after the cleanroom was built (rates for 1995-1997 were 20%, 32%, and 59%, respectively). Fertilization rates decreased between 1993 (74%) and 1994 (60%) and then steadily increased after cleanroom installation (62% in 1995, 71% in 1996, and 69% in 1997). The proportion of embryos past the four-cell stage decreased from 66% in 1993 to 61% in 1994 but then increased steadily in the years after the cleanroom was built (78%, 77%, and 83% in 1995, 1996, and 1997, respectively). During the same 5-year period, there were no differences in embryo quality or number of embryos transferred. CONCLUSION(S): Construction of a Class 100 cleanroom improved air quality and IVF rate and increased the number of embryos past the four-cell stage available for transfer.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the usefulness of and cost-effectiveness of antisperm antibody testing in the prediction of poor fertilization rates in couples undergoing IVF. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A hospital-based reproductive endocrinology and infertility practice. PATIENT(S): Male partners of 251 couples undergoing IVF between 1992 and 1997. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Fertilization rates in couples undergoing conventional IVF. RESULT(S): One hundred nineteen couples were evaluated for antisperm antibodies; fertilization rates were similar in those couples whose husbands were and were not tested (64% versus 68%). Antisperm antibodies were detected in 16 men. Four (25%) of the 16 couples whose husbands had antisperm antibodies fertilized < or = 50% of oocytes, compared with 31 (30%) of the 103 couples whose husbands did not have these antibodies. Overall, 21 couples (8.4%) experienced complete fertilization failure. In a program that included antisperm antibody testing for selected couples and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) for those who tested positive, it would cost $11,735 to prevent a fertilization failure (assuming ICSI were 100% effective), whereas it would cost $9,250 to perform ICSI in a second IVF cycle for those who initially failed. CONCLUSION(S): In this practice setting, antisperm antibody testing has low sensitivity in predicting low or no fertilization and does not appear to be cost-effective when selectively ordered as part of an IVF workup.",

        "abstract": "Sex steroids are postulated to play a role in adipose tissue regulation and distribution, because the amount and location of adipose tissue changes during puberty and menopause. Because of the nature of adipose tissue, receptors for the female sex steroids have been difficult to demonstrate. To date, estrogen receptor messenger RNA and protein have been identified in human subcutaneous adipose tissue, but the presence of progesterone receptor (PR) has not been reported. In this study, we demonstrate PR message by Northern blot analysis in RNA isolated from the abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue of premenopausal women. These preliminary studies revealed that PR messenger RNA levels are higher in the stromal-vascular fraction as opposed to the adipocyte fraction. Western blot analysis demonstrates both PR protein isoforms (human PR-A and human PR-B) in human subcutaneous adipose tissue. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, total PR could be quantitated. These studies substantiate that sex steroid receptors are present in human adipose tissue, thereby providing a direct route for regulation of adipose tissue by female sex steroids.",

STUDY DESIGN: Premenopausal women not taking exogenous sex steroids had transdermal 17 beta-estradiol and placebo patches placed in the gluteal region during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Adipose biopsies were performed from beneath the patches. Adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase activity was determined by a radiometric assay, protein mass was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and messenger ribonucleic acid level was determined by Northern analysis. Comparisons between the treated and placebo sides were analyzed by nonparametric statistics. RESULTS: Adipose tissue from beneath the 17 beta-estradiol patch had significantly decreased lipoprotein lipase activity and extracellular protein mass than did adipose tissue from beneath the placebo patch. There was no difference in lipoprotein lipase messenger ribonucleic acid levels. CONCLUSION: Estrogen decreases lipoprotein lipase activity by a posttranscriptional modification of protein levels. A hypothesis of sex steroid regulation of body fat distribution is proposed.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the levels of free estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2) in breast adipocytes of premenopausal women, premenopausal women using oral contraceptives (OCs), postmenopausal women, and postmenopausal women using estrogen replacement therapy (ERT). METHODS: Breast adipose tissue was obtained from 36 premenopausal and 29 postmenopausal women, and adipocytes were separated from stromal and epithelial cells through collagenase digestion and centrifugation. Oil was rendered from adipocytes, and E1 and E2 levels were measured by specific radioimmunoassays after extraction with methanol-water. RESULTS: Estrone and E2 levels were approximately 2.4- and 7.8-fold higher, respectively, in premenopausal women than in postmenopausal women. In premenopausal women, E1 and E2 correlated with the time since last menses (R2 = .55 and .62, respectively), whereas in postmenopausal women, E1 and E2 correlated with body mass index (BMI) (r = .48 and .52, respectively). Estrone levels were always greater than E2 levels in adipocytes, with the E1/E2 ratio being 2.7-fold higher in postmenopausal women than in premenopausal women. The use of OCs decreased E1 and E2 levels in premenopausal women, and ERT increased levels in postmenopausal women. CONCLUSION: Free estrogen in breast adipocytes is characterized by E1 dominance, with levels in premenopausal women correlating with the menstrual cycle and levels in postmenopausal women correlating with BMI.",

Since attempts have been made to correlate the ingestion of high-fat diets, itself a peroxisome proliferator, with the occurrence of breast cancer, we set about to determine if human breast cancer cells contained a functional PPAR. In this report we demonstrate the presence of an mRNA in two breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and T47D) which is specifically recognized by a mouse PPARgamma2 probe. Furthermore, in gel shift assays a consensus PPAR response element (PPRE) was specifically bound by nuclear extracts from MCF-7 cells and was further retarded by antibodies raised to mouse PPARgamma. Finally, when transfected with a PPRE-luciferase transcriptional reporter construct, transcription was increased in response to activators of PPAR and its dimmeric partner the retinoic acid X receptor (RXR). These data indicate that peroxisomal proliferators are capable of mediating transcription in human breast cells and suggest the possibility of a physiological role in the breast.",

METHODS: Single doses of micronized 17 beta-estradiol were administered orally (1 mg, 0.5 mg) or sublingually (1 mg, 0.5 mg, 0.25 mg) to six postmenopausal women in a randomized clinical trial. We calculated pharmacokinetic parameters for estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) of maximum serum concentration, time to maximum serum concentration, terminal half-life, area under the concentration curve, and oral clearance. Serum levels of E1 sulfate also were compared at 4, 12, and 24 hours after dosing. RESULTS: Sublingual administration resulted in rapid absorption with significantly higher E2 levels than did comparable oral dosing. Estrone levels did not vary with route of administration but correlated with the dosage administered. Estrone sulfate levels correlated with the dosage administered and also tended to be higher with sublingual administration. Sublingual administration resulted in a significantly lower E1 to E2 ratio during the 24 hours than did oral administration. CONCLUSION: Sublingual administration of micronized 17 beta-estradiol results in a rapid, burst-like absorption into the systemic circulation, yielding high E2 levels that fall rapidly over the first 6 hours.",

RESULTS: Adipocytes and stromal-vascular cells exist in a ratio of 2/1. RNA/DNA ratios are the same in the two cell fractions. CONCLUSION: In human subcutaneous adipose tissue, adipocytes are twice as numerous as stromal-vascular cells. The overall transcriptional activity of the cell types appears similar.",

        "abstract": "C19 steroids are converted to estrogens in a number of tissues by a specific form of cytochrome P450, namely aromatase cytochrome P450 (P450arom). Adipose tissue is the principal site of estrogen formation in postmenopausal women. Aromatase activity as well as P450arom transcripts primarily reside in the stromal cell component of the adipose tissue. Studies designed to investigate whether increased local aromatase activity in breast adipose tissue influences the growth of breast cancers have yielded discrepant results. In an attempt to clarify this controversy, adipose tissue was obtained from the four breast quadrants at the time of mastectomy (n = 13) performed for removal of a tumor. Breast fat P450arom messenger RNA levels were quantified and compared between the four quadrants within each specimen using competitive polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription in which 10 micrograms human adipose total RNA together with 1 pg rat complementary RNA (internal standard) were reverse transcribed and coamplified. In 9 out of 13 patients (69%), highest P450arom transcript levels colocalized to the quadrants bearing tumors. This correlation was statistically significant (P < 0.001). The regional distribution of P450arom transcripts in breast adipose tissue of disease-free individuals, obtained during reduction mammoplasty (control group, n = 9), did not favor any particular region of the breast. We also quantified by morphometry the histological components of the adipose tissue samples from each quadrant in mastectomy specimens. The distribution of stromal cells significantly correlated with the distribution of P450arom transcript levels, in that quadrants containing highest proportions of stromal cells matched to highest transcript levels (P < 0.01). Although the quadrants bearing tumors contained the highest percentage of stromal cells, this correlation was not statistically significant. The adipose tissue surrounding a breast tumor displays increased estrogen biosynthesis, which may promote tumor growth. It is further suggested that the distribution of stromal cell components in breast adipose tissue gives rise to locally elevated P450arom expression, which in turn may favor neoplastic development and growth in these predisposed areas of the breast. The correlation between the presence of a tumor and elevated P450arom levels in the proximal adipose tissue is independent of tumor size, node involvement, histological type or grade, estrogen/progesterone receptor status, DNA index, or S-phase fraction.",

        "abstract": "Clinical evidence suggests that sex hormones affect adipose tissue metabolism and deposition. To investigate the biosynthesis and possible action of estrogen in adipose tissue, we report the use of competitive, specific polymerase chain reaction amplifications to determine levels of estrogen receptor (ER) messenger RNA (mRNA) and cytochrome P450 aromatase mRNA in adipocytes and adipose stromal cells. This extremely sensitive technique uses coamplification of a homologous animal species complementary RNA to control for differences in amplification efficiencies. The DNA amplification products are identified by Southern hybridization with species-specific radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes. Abdominal adipose tissue obtained from female patients during elective abdominoplasty was separated by collagenase digestion and centrifugation into floating adipocytes and pelleted adipose stromal cells. Our results demonstrate higher ER mRNA levels in adipocytes compared to adipose stromal cells, whereas cytochrome P450 aromatase mRNA levels are higher in adipose stromal cells compared to adipocytes. The finding of ER mRNA in adipose tissue suggests the presence of the ER in adipose tissue. In addition the inverse correlation of ER mRNA and cytochrome P450 aromatase mRNA levels in adipocytes and adipose stromal cells suggests a paracrine relationship whereby estrogen produced by adipose stromal cells affects adjacent adipocytes.",

STUDY DESIGN: A single-dose study was performed with five patients and four controls, followed by a multiple-dose study with five subjects in each group. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental analysis and statistical analysis performed with Mann-Whitney U testing. RESULTS: There is no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters for norethindrone in peritoneal dialysis patients compared with normal women. During multiple dosing an increased area under the concentration curve and decreased apparent oral clearance was observed for ethinyl estradiol in peritoneal dialysis patients compared with normal women. CONCLUSION: Peritoneal dialysis patients have decreased apparent oral clearance of ethinyl estradiol, leading to slightly higher serum concentrations compared with women with normal renal function. The clearance of norethindrone is the same in peritoneal dialysis patients and normal women.",

        "abstract": "Local production of estrogen in breast tissue may influence the growth of breast cancers. Peripheral conversion of C19 steroids to estrogens is catalyzed by the aromatase enzyme complex which is comprised of a specific form of cytochrome P450, aromatase cytochrome P450 (P450AROM) and the flavoprotein, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase. To evaluate P450AROM mRNA levels in breast tissue, a specific competitive polymerase chain reaction amplification procedure was devised. In this method, a rat P450AROM complementary RNA is coamplified as an internal standard in order to compare amplification reactions. The amplification products are recognized by hybridization with 32P-labeled oligonucleotides specific for each species. Densitometry is used to quantitate autoradiographs. Initial studies using RNA from whole breast tissue obtained from reduction mammoplasty revealed linearity of the relationship between the densitometer signal from the human amplification product and total RNA concentration. Breast tissue was then separated into a floating adipocyte fraction and a pelleted fraction containing the other cellular elements by collagenase digestion and centrifugation. Comparison of specific content of aromatase amplification product per unit weight of RNA extracted from adipocytes and pelleted cells revealed considerably higher levels in the RNA from the nonadipocyte fraction. Immunocytochemical characterization of this fraction revealed the presence of several cell types including macrophages, ductal epithelial cells, and endothelial cells, but primary cells of stromal origin.",

        "abstract": "Aromatase cytochrome P-450 (P-450AROM) is the enzyme in the steroidogenic pathway controlling the formation of oestrogens from 19 carbon steroid precursors. Aromatase is present in various tissues of the human fetus. The liver is second only to the placenta in the level of P-450AROM activity in the fetus. In this study we examined the effects of type 1 transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) on P-450AROM expression in human fetal (HF) hepatocytes. The HF hepatocytes were dispersed into single cells which were placed into monolayer cell culture until confluent. Cells were then rinsed and treated in serum-free media with dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bu2cAMP) for 72 h. Treatment with Bu2cAMP (2 mmol/l) caused a fivefold increase in aromatase activity in hepatocytes. The increase in aromatase activity apparently represented an increase in P-450AROM enzyme as determined by immunoblotting using an antibody directed against human placental aromatase. TGF beta blocked basal, as well as Bu2cAMP increases, in aromatase activity by over 50%. The effect of TGF beta was dose-dependent with maximal inhibition observed using 2-5 ng TGF beta/ml. Immunodetectable P-450AROM decreased in parallel with activity following TGF beta treatment. The mechanism of TGF beta action was not through increasing phosphodiesterase (PDE) breakdown of cAMP since inhibition of PDE had no effect on TGF beta action. Finally we examined the level of P-450AROM mRNA using competitive polymerase chain reaction amplification. Bu2cAMP increased mRNA levels of P-450AROM by 2.5-fold, while TGF beta inhibited this induction by 35%. The results of this investigation demonstrated that TGF beta is a potent regulator of P-450AROM expression in HF hepatocytes.",

Aromatase activities ranging from moderate to very low have been measured in human fetal tissues. The inability to demonstrate aromatase cytochrome P450 (P450AROM) messenger RNA (mRNA) in several fetal tissues by northern blotting has been attributed to low levels of specific message. In order to identify and compare P450AROM mRNA levels in fetal tissues, we developed a specific competitive polymerase chain reaction amplification technique. This reaction uses coamplification of a rat P450AROM complementary RNA to normalize differences in amplification efficiencies. Using this technique, P450AROM mRNA was identified in all fetal tissues studied including; liver, lung, brain, skin, intestine, kidney, spleen, and heart. Fetal liver contained far more P450AROM mRNA per total RNA than any other tissues studied. Fetal brain and intestine also tended to have slightly higher levels than other tissues.",

DNA sequence analysis indicates that the gene has a putative TATA (ATAAAA) sequence at -23 bp and putative CAAT binding sequences beginning at -41, -67, and -83 bp, that constitute a promoter region responsible for expression in placenta. However, this promoter does not appear to be responsible for expression in adipose, which may therefore be under the control of another, tissue-specific, promoter. Use of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology has allowed for determination of expression of P-450AROM in samples of breast adipose. Preliminary results indicate that expression is highest in the upper lateral region, similar to the site of most frequent localization of tumors.",

Prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase activity has been demonstrated in human fetal membranes and decidua. Using immunohistochemical techniques, we identified in these tissues the cell types that contain prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase. A total of 33 specimens, ranging from 8 wk to 42 wk gestation, were studied. Decidualized stromal cells stained the most intensely and consistently of all cell types. Cytotrophoblast of the chorion and early placental villi and syncytotrophoblast of all gestational ages demonstrated a lighter, more variable staining pattern. Regardless of gestational age, amnion stained in a heterogeneous fashion, with some cells demonstrating an intense staining and other cells having no staining. There were no observable differences in laboring compared to nonlaboring term specimens. In summary, the specific cell types that contain immunoreactive prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase have been identified in fetal membranes and decidua.",

        "abstract": "Amniotic fluid embolism is a catastrophic event of the intra- and early postpartum period which may also be seen with cesarean delivery and during abortions. Presenting symptomatology includes respiratory distress with cyanosis, shock, and possibly tonic-clonic seizures. DIC frequently occurs. The pathogenesis may include entry of amniotic fluid through lacerations or ruptures of the uterus or cervix, through endocervical veins and through abnormal uteroplacental sites, such as with placental abruption, placenta previa, or placenta accreta. Amniotic fluid probably causes cardiovascular-respiratory symptoms by pulmonary vascular obstruction and through a vasoactive substance causing pulmonary vascular constriction. The lethality of amniotic fluid may be enhanced by a high particulate content or meconium staining. The diagnosis of amniotic fluid embolism may be made ante mortem by demonstrating amniotic fluid debris in central blood samples or expectorated sputum. Postmortem diagnosis often requires meticulous examination of the pulmonary microvasculature with the utilization of special stains. Treatment is directed towards symptoms of shock, arterial hypoxemia, and DIC. Acute renal failure may complicate the picture after shock. If the patient survives the embolic and coagulative problems, recovery is usually complete without long-term sequelae.",

    "overview": "Dr. Price is involved in both clinical and basic science research. The main focus of the basic science molecular endocrinology laboratory is the study of novel sex steroid receptors. Currently, the work focuses on a novel progesterone receptor that localizes to the mitochondrion. Studies including RNAi in cell models and creation of transgenic mice are ongoing to discover the function of this receptor. The overall hypothesis is that progesterone modulates mitochondrial activity to meet the increased cellular energy demands of pregnancy via this receptor. <br />Dr. Price also participates in clinical research endeavors. These projects are constantly changing and focus on many aspects of reproductive endocrinology including ovarian preservation during chemotherapy, treatments for menorrhagia, endometriosis, leiomyomata and infertility.",
