            "abstract":"At oceanic depths >200 m, there is little ambient sunlight, but bioluminescent organisms provide another light source that can reveal animals to visual predators and prey [1-4]. Transparency and mirrored surfaces-common camouflage strategies under the diffuse solar illumination of shallower waters-are conspicuous when illuminated by directed bioluminescent sources due to reflection from the body surface [5, 6]. Pigmentation allows animals to absorb light from bioluminescent sources, rendering them visually undetectable against the dark background of the deep sea [5]. We present evidence suggesting pressure to reduce reflected bioluminescence led to the evolution of ultra-black skin (reflectance <0.5%) in 16 species of deep-sea fishes across seven distantly related orders. Histological data suggest this low reflectance is mediated by a continuous layer of densely packed melanosomes in the exterior-most layer of the dermis [7, 8] and that this layer lacks the unpigmented gaps between pigment cells found in other darkly colored fishes [9-13]. Using finite-difference, time-domain modeling and comparisons with melanosomes found in other ectothermic vertebrates [11, 13-21], we find the melanosomes making up the layer in these ultra-black species are optimized in size and shape to minimize reflectance. Low reflectance results from melanosomes scattering light within the layer, increasing the optical path length and therefore light absorption by the melanin. By reducing reflectance, ultra-black fish can reduce the sighting distance of visual predators more than 6-fold compared to fish with 2% reflectance. This biological example of efficient light absorption via a simple architecture of strongly absorbing and highly scattering particles may inspire new ultra-black materials.",

            "abstract":"As extracellular proteins age, they undergo and accumulate nonenzymatic post-translational modifications that cannot be repaired. We hypothesized that these could be used to systemically monitor loss of extracellular matrix due to chronic arthritic diseases such as osteoarthritis (OA). To test this, we predicted sites of deamidation in cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) and confirmed, by mass spectroscopy, the presence of deamidated (Asp(64)) and native (Asn(64)) COMP epitopes (mean 0.95% deamidated COMP (D-COMP) relative to native COMP) in cartilage. An Asp(64), D-COMP-specific ELISA was developed using a newly created monoclonal antibody 6-1A12. In a joint replacement study, serum D-COMP (p = 0.017), but not total COMP (p = 0.5), declined significantly after replacement demonstrating a joint tissue source for D-COMP. In analyses of 450 participants from the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project controlled for age, gender, and race, D-COMP was associated with radiographic hip (p < 0.0001) but not knee (p = 0.95) OA severity. In contrast, total COMP was associated with radiographic knee (p < 0.0001) but not hip (p = 0.47) OA severity. D-COMP was higher in soluble proteins extracted from hip cartilage proximal to OA lesions compared with remote from lesions (p = 0.007) or lesional and remote OA knee (p < 0.01) cartilage. Total COMP in cartilage did not vary by joint site or proximity to the lesion. This study demonstrates the presence of D-COMP in articular cartilage and the systemic circulation, and to our knowledge, it is the first biomarker to show specificity for a particular joint site. We believe that enrichment of deamidated epitope in hip OA cartilage indicates a lesser repair response of hip OA compared with knee OA cartilage.",

            "abstract":"Photoluminescent nanofibers (PLN) can be formed by combining electrospun polymeric nanofibers and luminescent particles such as quantum dots (QD). The physical properties of PLNs are dependent upon many different nanoscale parameters associated with the nanofiber, the luminescent particles, and their interactions. By understanding and manipulating these properties, the performance of the resulting optical structure can be tailored for desired end-use applications. For example, the quantum efficiency of quantum dots in the PLN structure depends upon multiple parameters including quantum dot chemistry, the method of forming the PLN nanocomposites, and preventing agglomeration of the quantum dot particles. This is especially important in solution-based electrospinning environments where some common solvents may have a detrimental effect on the performance of the PLN. With the proper control of these parameters, high quantum efficiencies can be readily obtained for PLNs. Achieving high quantum efficiencies is critical in applications such as solid-state lighting where PLNs can be an effective secondary conversion material for producing white light. Methods of optimizing the performance of PLNs through nanoscale manipulation of the nanofiber are discussed along with guidelines for tailoring the performance of nanofibers and quantum dots for application-specific requirements. © 2010 Materials Research Society.",

      "interestsOverview":"<strong>Investigating temperature impacts on snapping shrimp claw kinematics<br /></strong>Most movements in the animal kingdom are driven by direct muscle power. Such movements are limited in power-output, but some animals use specialized power amplification mechanisms to exceed this threshold and generate the fastest movements in the animal kingdom. One of these animals is the snapping shrimp, which produces the second loudest sound in the ocean using their specialized mechanism to close their claw at super-high speeds. Little is known about how temperature impacts these mechanisms, and the goal of this project is to increase this understanding. <br /><br />We have 1 opening in our lab. Students, click <a href=\"https://muser.duke.edu/projects/investigating-temperature-impacts-snapping-shrimp-claw-kinematics\">here </a>to apply in Muser!",
