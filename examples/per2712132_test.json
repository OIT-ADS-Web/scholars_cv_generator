        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between vitamin D levels in the male partner and fertility outcomes in couples with mild male factor infertility. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Nine fertility centers in the United States. PATIENT(S): Men (n = 154) with sperm concentration between 5 and 15 million/mL, motility ≤40%, or normal morphology ≤4% were eligible. Female partners were ovulatory, ≤40 years old, and had documented tubal patency. INTERVENTION(S): Men provided semen and blood at baseline for semen analysis and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels. They were randomly assigned to receive a vitamin formulation including vitamin D 2,000 IU daily or placebo for up to 6 months. Couples attempted to conceive naturally during the first 3 months and with clomiphene citrate with intrauterine insemination of the female partner in months 4 through 6. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Primary: sperm concentration, motility, morphology, and DNA fragmentation at baseline. Secondary: cumulative pregnancy, miscarriage, and live birth rates. RESULT(S): Semen parameters and sperm DNA fragmentation were not statistically significantly different between men with vitamin D deficiency and men with 25(OH)D levels ≥20 ng/mL. In addition, clinical pregnancy and live birth rates were similar. Male 25(OH)D level <20 ng/mL was associated with a higher rate of pregnancy loss (adjusted odds ratio 9.0; 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 61.3). CONCLUSION(S): Vitamin D deficiency in the male partner did not significantly impact semen parameters or treatment outcomes. Further study is warranted to better characterize the rate of miscarriage in couples with male vitamin D deficiency.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To determine if a policy of universal fetal echocardiography (echo) in pregnancies conceived by in-vitro fertilization (IVF) is cost-effective as a screening strategy for congenital heart defects (CHDs) and to examine the cost-effectiveness of various other CHD screening strategies in IVF pregnancies. METHODS: A decision-analysis model was designed from a societal perspective with respect to the obstetric patient, to compare the cost-effectiveness of three screening strategies: (1) anatomic ultrasound (US): selective fetal echo following abnormal cardiac findings on detailed anatomic survey; (2) intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) only: fetal echo for all pregnancies following IVF with ICSI; (3) all IVF: fetal echo for all IVF pregnancies. The model initiated at conception and had a time horizon of 1 year post-delivery. The sensitivities and specificities for each strategy, the probabilities of major and minor CHDs and all other clinical estimates were derived from the literature. Costs, including imaging, consults, surgeries and caregiver productivity losses, were derived from the literature and Medicare databases, and are expressed in USA dollars ($). Effectiveness was quantified as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), based on how the strategies would affect the quality of life of the obstetric patient. Secondary effectiveness was quantified as number of cases of CHD and, specifically, cases of major CHD, detected. RESULTS: The average base-case cost of each strategy was as follows: anatomic US, $8119; ICSI only, $8408; and all IVF, $8560. The effectiveness of each strategy was as follows: anatomic US, 1.74487 QALYs; ICSI only, 1.74497 QALYs; and all IVF, 1.74499 QALYs. The ICSI-only strategy had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $2 840 494 per additional QALY gained when compared to the anatomic-US strategy, and the all-IVF strategy had an ICER of $5 692 457 per additional QALY when compared with the ICSI-only strategy. Both ICERs exceeded considerably the standard willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000-$100 000 per QALY. In a secondary analysis, the ICSI-only strategy had an ICER of $527 562 per additional case of major CHD detected when compared to the anatomic-US strategy. All IVF had an ICER of $790 510 per case of major CHD detected when compared with ICSI only. It was determined that it would cost society five times more to detect one additional major CHD through intensive screening of all IVF pregnancies than it would cost to pay for the neonate's first year of care. CONCLUSION: The most cost-effective method of screening for CHDs in pregnancies following IVF, either with or without ICSI, is to perform a fetal echo only when abnormal cardiac findings are noted on the detailed anatomy scan. Performing routine fetal echo for all IVF pregnancies is not cost-effective. © 2020 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To determine if pre-implantation genetic testing (PGT) shifts the sex ratio (SER), the ratio of male to female births in a population normalized to 100 and typically stable at 105, following in vitro fertilization (IVF). METHODS: Data from 2014 to 2016 was requested from the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technologies (SART) database including fresh and frozen transfer cycles. Women with a singleton live birth following a fresh or frozen autologous embryo transfer of a PGT blastocyst, non-PGT blastocyst, or non-PGT cleavage stage embryo were included. The SER between groups was compared using chi-square tests. Modified Poisson regression modeled the relative risk (RR) of having a male compared to a female among PGT blastocyst transfers versus non-PGT cleavage and blastocyst transfers adjusting for age, BMI, smoking status, race, parity, number of oocytes retrieved, and clinic region. RESULTS: The SER was 110 among PGT blastocyst offspring, 107 among non-PGT blastocyst offspring (p = 0.005), and 99 among non-PGT cleavage offspring (p < 0.001). The risk of having a male infant was 2% higher among PGT blastocyst transfers compared to non-PGT blastocyst transfers (RR 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.04). The risk was 5% higher among PGT blastocyst transfers compared to non-PGT cleavage transfers (RR 1.05; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.07). The association between PGT and infant gender did not significantly differ by region (p = 0.57) or parity (p = 0.59). CONCLUSION: Utilizing PGT shifts the SER in the IVF population from the standard of 105 to 110, increasing the probability of a male offspring.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies investigating the effects of pain-relieving medication use on conceiving a pregnancy have shown conflicting results. Furthermore, no previous study has examined medication use around ovulation or implantation and the associations with the probability of conception, fecundability. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to explore the association between fecundability and analgesic use in 3 different menstrual cycle windows (preovulation, periovulation, and implantation) as well as across the entire menstrual cycle. STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed data from a prospective cohort study of women between 30 and 44 years of age who were trying to conceive naturally from 2008 through 2015. Using daily diaries, medication usage was classified as acetaminophen, aspirin, or nonaspirin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug during 4 time periods of interest (preovulatory, periovulatory, and implantation) as well as the overall nonmenstrual bleeding days of the cycle. Menstrual cycles during the prospective attempt to become pregnant were enumerated using daily diary menstrual bleeding information. Conception was defined as a positive home pregnancy test. Discrete time fecundability models were used to estimate the fecundability ratio and 95% confidence interval in each of the 4 time windows of interest and for each pain reliever (aspirin use, nonaspirin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use, acetaminophen) compared with no medication use after adjustment for several covariates including age, race, education, body mass index, alcohol and caffeine use, frequency of intercourse, and a history of migraines or uterine fibroids. RESULTS: Medication use was infrequent in the 858 women and 2366 cycles in this analysis. Use of nonaspirin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or acetaminophen was not associated with fecundability in any of the time windows of interest. Although the sample size was small, aspirin use during the implantation window was associated with increased fecundability (adjusted fecundability ratio [confidence interval]: 2.05 [1.23-3.41]). This association remained when limiting the analysis to cycles with minimal missing data or when adjusting for gravidity. None of the other medications were associated with fecundability. CONCLUSION: Aspirin use around implantation was associated with increased fecundability. These results expand previous literature to suggest the following: (1) implantation may be an important target for the effects of aspirin on conception and (2) aspirin may be beneficial, regardless of pregnancy loss history. These observations should be tested with a clinical trial.",

        "abstract": "STUDY QUESTION: Are serum omega-3 and omega-6 essential fatty acid concentrations associated with the probability of conceiving? SUMMARY ANSWER: There is no strong association between serum concentrations of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids and the probability of conceiving naturally. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid serum concentrations have been shown to play an important role in reproduction in animal models, while conflicting results have been reported in human studies of infertile women. It is unknown to what extent omega fatty acid serum concentrations impact natural fertility. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A nested, case-control study was conducted consisting of 200 participants [fertile: conceived within 3 cycles of attempt (n = 50), subfertile: conceived within 4 and 12 cycles of attempt (n = 100) and infertile: did not conceive within 12 cycles of attempt (n = 50)] randomly selected from the Time to Conceive cohort, a prospective time-to-pregnancy study (2008 to 2015). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: In the Time to Conceive study, women aged 30-44 years who were trying to conceive for <3 months and had no history of infertility were recruited and followed until the end of their pregnancy or ~1 year of pregnancy attempt. For this study, serum collected early in the woman's pregnancy attempt was analysed for anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid concentrations by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The primary outcome was a positive home pregnancy test. The secondary outcomes were miscarriage and serum AMH level. A discrete-time Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the fecundability ratio. The odds ratios for miscarriage were calculated using logistic regression. The association between serum omega fatty acid concentrations and AMH level (natural log transformed) was analysed using Pearson's Correlation. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A total of 200 women provided 1321 cycles for analysis.Mean omega-3, omega-6 and omega-6:omega-3 ratios did not significantly differ between the fertile, subfertile and infertile groups. There were no associations (all fecundability ratios ~1.0) between pregnancy and individual omega-3 fatty acid concentrations, including alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, or omega-6 fatty acids, including linoleic acid (LA), dihommo-gamma linolenic acid and arachidonic acid. There was no significant association between any individual omega fatty acid serum concentration and the age-adjusted odds of miscarriage. No association was found between any serum omega fatty acid concentration and AMH. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study is limited by the sample size. Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid concentrations were derived from serum provided at a single timepoint in the first cycle of enrollment. Serum concentrations may therefore not be representative of all critical timepoints in the menstrual cycle or throughout their attempts to conceive. Additionally, women enrolled in this study were 30 years of age and older, and therefore the findings may not apply to younger women. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: These data would suggest that omega-3 and omega-6 serum levels are not associated with natural fertility or risk of miscarriage. However, due to the above-mentioned limitations, future investigation is still needed to determine whether omega-3 fatty acid supplementation may benefit women planning to conceive naturally. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This study was supported by the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, by the NIH/NICHD (R21 HD060229-01 and R01 HD067683-01) and, in part, by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (Z01ES103333).

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition of androgen excess in women, is associated with cardiometabolic risk factors; however, this association is not fully characterized in a population-based sample of premenopausal women and high-risk groups such as Hispanics/Latinas. OBJECTIVE: We examined the association of PCOS signs and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in premenopausal Hispanic/Latina women. METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis includes 1427 women age 24 to 44 years from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos. PCOS signs included menstrual cycle greater than 35 days or irregular, self-reported PCOS, and oral contraceptive use to regulate periods or acne, and a composite of 1 or more PCOS signs. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI for MetS, accounting for sociodemographic factors and the complex survey design; an additional model included body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: The mean age was 34 years and 30% reported any PCOS sign. The odds of MetS were higher in women reporting cycles greater than 35 days or irregular (OR 1.63; CI: 1.07-2.49) vs cycles 24 to 35 days, self-reported PCOS (OR 2.49; CI: 1.38-4.50) vs no PCOS, and any PCOS sign (OR 1.58; CI: 1.10-2.26) vs none. We found no association between OC use to regulate periods or acne and MetS (OR 1.1; CI: 0.6-1.8). When adjusting for BMI, only the association of self-reported PCOS and MetS was attenuated (OR 1.78; CI: 0.92-3.44). CONCLUSIONS: In Hispanic/Latina women, irregular menstrual cycles, self-reported PCOS, and any PCOS sign were associated with MetS and could indicate women at metabolic disease risk.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether antioxidants improve male fertility, as measured by semen parameters and DNA fragmentation at 3 months and pregnancy resulting in live birth after up to 6 months of treatment, among couples with male factor infertility. DESIGN: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with an internal pilot study. SETTING: Nine fertility centers in the United States from December 2015 to December 2018. PATIENT(S): Men (N = 174) with sperm concentration ≤15 million/mL, motility ≤40%, normal morphology ≤4%, or DNA fragmentation >25%, and female partners who were ovulatory, ≤40 years old, and had documented tubal patency. INTERVENTION(S): Males randomly assigned to receive an antioxidant formulation (n = 85) containing 500 mg of vitamin C, 400 mg of vitamin E, 0.20 mg of selenium, 1,000 mg of l-carnitine, 20 mg of zinc, 1,000 μg of folic acid, 10 mg of lycopene daily, or placebo (n = 86). Treatment lasted for a minimum of 3 months and maximum of 6 months, and couples attempted to conceive naturally during the first 3 months and with clomiphene citrate with intrauterine insemination of the female partner in months 4 through 6. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Primary outcome was live birth; secondary outcomes included pregnancy within 6 months of treatment. For the internal pilot, the primary outcomes were semen parameters and sperm DNA fragmentation index after 3 months of treatment. RESULT(S): In the Males, Antioxidants, and Infertility (MOXI) study, after 3 months of treatment, the change in sperm concentration differed between the antioxidant group (median -4.0 [interquartile range-12.0, 5.7] million/mL) and placebo group (+2.4 [-9.0, 15.5] million/mL). However, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups for changes in sperm morphology, motility, or DNA fragmentation. Among the 66 oligospermic men at randomization, sperm concentration did not differ at 3 months between the antioxidant and control groups: 8.5 (4.8, 15.0) million/mL versus 15.0 (6.0, 24.0) million/mL. Of the 75 asthenospermic men, motility did not differ at 3 months: 34% ± 16.3% versus 36.4% ± 15.8%. Among the 44 men with high DNA fragmentation, DNA fragmentation did not differ at 3 months: 29.5% (21.6%, 36.5%) versus 28.0% (20.6%, 36.4%). In the entire cohort, cumulative live birth did not differ at 6 months between the antioxidant and placebo groups: 15% versus 24%. CONCLUSION(S): Antioxidants do not improve semen parameters or DNA integrity among men with male factor infertility. Although limited by sample size, this study suggests that antioxidant treatment of the male partner does not improve in vivo pregnancy or live-birth rates.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To provide evidence-based recommendations to practicing physicians and others regarding the effectiveness and safety of therapies for unexplained infertility. METHODS: ASRM conducted a literature search, which included systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and prospective and retrospective comparative observational studies published from 1968 through 2019. The ASRM Practice Committee and a task force of experts used available evidence and informal consensus to develop evidence-based guideline recommendations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Outcomes of interest included: live-birth rate, clinical pregnancy rate, implantation rate, fertilization rate, multiple pregnancy rate, dose of treatment, rate of ovarian hyperstimulation, abortion rate, and ectopic pregnancy rate. RESULT(S): The literature search identified 88 relevant studies to inform the evidence base for this guideline. RECOMMENDATION(S): Evidence-based recommendations were developed for the following treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: natural cycle with intrauterine insemination (IUI); clomiphene citrate with intercourse; aromatase inhibitors with intercourse; gonadotropins with intercourse; clomiphene citrate with IUI; aromatase inhibitors with IUI; combination of clomiphene citrate or letrozole and gonadotropins (low dose and conventional dose) with IUI; low-dose gonadotropins with IUI; conventional-dose gonadotropins with IUI; timing of IUI; and in vitro fertilization and treatment paradigms. CONCLUSION(S): The treatment of unexplained infertility is by necessity empiric. For most couples, the best initial therapy is a course (typically 3 or 4 cycles) of ovarian stimulation with oral medications and intrauterine insemination (OS-IUI) followed by in vitro fertilization for those unsuccessful with OS-IUI treatments.",

        "abstract": "STUDY QUESTION: Is pre-conception 25(OH)D associated with the per cycle probability of conception, i.e fecundability, in a prospective cohort study? SUMMARY ANSWER: There are suggestive associations of high 25(OH)D (at least 50 ng/ml) with increased fecundability and low 25(OH)D (<20 ng/ml) with reduced fecundability, but the estimates were imprecise. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Vitamin D has been associated with reproductive function and fertility in animal studies, but few human studies exist. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This community-based prospective cohort study included 522 women attempting to become pregnant between 2010 and 2016. The women completed online daily and monthly diaries until a positive home pregnancy test was observed or 12 months had elapsed. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The study included women from central North Carolina who were aged 30-44 with no history of infertility, with no more than 3 months of attempt time at recruitment. Women recorded vaginal bleeding so that the ongoing number of attempt cycles could be counted and used to quantify a woman's pregnancy attempt time. Blood collected at the study entry was analysed for 25(OH)D using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Associations with fecundability were estimated with a log-binomial discrete time-to-event model. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Among 522 women, 257 conceived during the study. The mean age was 33 years and the mean 25(OH)D was 36 ng/ml. There was an estimated 10% higher fecundability with each 10 ng/ml increase in 25(OH)D (fecundability ratio (FR) 1.10, 95% CI: 0.96, 1.25). The suggestive dose-response association with the continuous measure of 25(OH)D was driven by women in the lowest and the highest categories of 25(OH)D. Compared to women with 25(OH)D of 30-40 ng/ml, women below 20 ng/ml had an estimated 45% reduction in fecundability (FR (CI): 0.55 (0.23, 1.32)), and women with at least 50 ng/ml had an estimated 35% increase in fecundability (FR (CI): 1.35 (0.95, 1.91)). Across these three categories (25(OH)D of <20 ng/ml, 30-40 ng/ml and > 50 ng/ml), the probability of taking longer than 6 months to conceive was, respectively, 51% (17%, 74%), 28% (17%, 39%) and 15% (10%, 37%). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: While the distribution of 25(OH)D was wide, the number of observed cycles with high 25(OH)D (N = 107) or low 25(OH)D (N = 56) was small. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our findings are consistent with prior reports of reduced fertility in women with 25(OH)D concentrations below the clinically defined deficiency level (20 ng/ml). Further studies are needed to evaluate the possible reproductive benefits of considerably higher 25(OH)D concentration (>50 ng/ml). STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This research was supported by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under award numbers R00HD079659 and R01HD067683 and supported in part by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, under projects ES103086, ES049003 and ES044003.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preconception health may have intergenerational influences. We have formed the PrePARED (Preconception Period Analysis of Risks and Exposures influencing health and Development) research consortium to address methodological, conceptual, and generalisability gaps in the literature. OBJECTIVES: The consortium will investigate the effects of preconception exposures on four sets of outcomes: (1) fertility and miscarriage; (2) pregnancy-related conditions; (3) perinatal and child health; and (4) adult health outcomes. POPULATION: A study is eligible if it has data measured for at least one preconception time point, has a minimum of selected core data, and is open to collaboration and data harmonisation. DESIGN: The included studies are a mix of studies following women or couples intending to conceive, general-health cohorts that cover the reproductive years, and pregnancy/child cohort studies that have been linked with preconception data. The majority of the participating studies are prospective cohorts, but a few are clinical trials or record linkages. METHODS: Data analysis will begin with harmonisation of data collected across cohorts. Initial areas of interest include nutrition and obesity; tobacco, marijuana, and other substance use; and cardiovascular risk factors. PRELIMINARY RESULTS: Twenty-three cohorts with data on almost 200 000 women have combined to form this consortium, begun in 2018. Twelve studies are of women or couples actively planning pregnancy, and six are general-population cohorts that cover the reproductive years; the remainder have some other design. The primary focus for four was cardiovascular health, eight was fertility, one was environmental exposures, three was child health, and the remainder general women's health. Among other cohorts assessed for inclusion, the most common reason for ineligibility was lack of prospectively collected preconception data. CONCLUSIONS: The consortium will serve as a resource for research in many subject areas related to preconception health, with implications for science, practice, and policy.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: We sought to determine whether lower fertility related quality of life or depression in men of couples with unexplained infertility is associated with low total testosterone levels, abnormal semen quality or erectile dysfunction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is a secondary analysis of a large, multicenter, randomized controlled trial in couples with unexplained infertility. Male partners underwent baseline semen analysis with measurement of fasting total testosterone and gonadotropin. They also completed surveys, including the FertiQOL (Fertility Quality of Life), the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) and the IIEF (International Index of Erectile Function). The primary study outcomes were total testosterone with low total testosterone defined as less than 264 ng/dl, semen parameters and the IIEF score. We performed multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusted for patient age, race, body mass index, education, smoking, alcohol use, infertility duration and comorbidity. RESULTS: A total of 708 men with a mean ± SD age of 34.2 ± 5.6 were included in study. Of the men 59 (8.3%) had a PHQ-9 score of 5 or greater, which was consistent with depression, 99 (14.0%) had low total testosterone and 63 (9.0%) had mild or worse erectile dysfunction. Neither the FertiQOL score nor depression was associated with total testosterone or any semen parameter. The FertiQOL score was inversely associated with erectile dysfunction (for every 5-point score decline AOR 1.30, 95% CI 1.16-1.46). Depressed men were significantly more likely to have erectile dysfunction than nondepressed men (AOR 6.31, 95% CI 3.12-12.77). CONCLUSIONS: In men in couples with unexplained infertility lower fertility related quality of life and depression are strongly associated with erectile dysfunction. However, neither is associated with spermatogenesis or testosterone levels. Erectile dysfunction in infertile men merits longitudinal investigation in future studies.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between biomarkers of ovarian reserve and luteal phase deficiency (LPD). DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a prospective time-to-conceive cohort study. SETTING: Not applicable. PATIENT(S): Women attempting conception, aged 30-44 years, without known infertility. INTERVENTION(S): Measurement of early follicular phase serum levels of antimüllerian hormone, FSH, inhibin B, and E2. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The primary outcome was LPD, defined by luteal bleeding (LB) (≥1 day of LB) or a short luteal phase length (≤11 days). RESULT(S): Overall, 755 women provided information on 2,171 menstrual cycles and serum for measurement of at least one biomarker of ovarian reserve. There were 2,096 cycles from 754 women in the LB cohort, of which 40% experienced LB. After adjusting for age, race, previous miscarriages, and previous pregnancies, diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) was not significantly associated with LB. Low early follicular phase FSH levels increased the odds of LB (odds ratio [OR] 1.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25-2.71), as did high early follicular phase E2 levels (OR 1.59; 95% CI 1.26-2.01). A total of 608 cycles from 286 women were included in the analysis of luteal phase length, of which 13% had a short luteal phase. After adjusting for age, there was no significant association between DOR and a short luteal phase. The risk of a short luteal phase decreased with increasing inhibin B (OR 0.61; 95% CI 0.45-0.81). CONCLUSION(S): Although DOR is not associated with LPD, hormone dysfunction in the early follicular phase may contribute to LPD in women of older reproductive age.",

DESIGN: Secondary analysis of the prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trial, Assessment of Multiple Intrauterine Gestations from Ovarian Stimulation (AMIGOS). SETTING: Infertility clinics. PATIENT(S): Nine hundred couples with unexplained infertility enrolled in AMIGOS. Semen analysis with an ejaculate of at least 5 million total motile sperm was required for enrollment. For inclusion in this secondary analysis, a fasting TT was required. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Logistic regression, adjusted for age and body mass index, assessed the association between low TT (defined as <264 ng/dL), semen parameters, and pregnancy outcome. RESULT(S): Seven hundred eighty-one men (mean age, 34.2 ± 5.7 years) with a median (interquartile range) TT of 411 (318-520) ng/dL were included. Men with TT <264 ng/dL were less likely to have normal (≥4% strict Kruger) morphology (unadjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.34, 0.92; adjusted OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.35, 0.99). There was no association between low TT and semen volume < 1.5 mL, sperm concentration < 15 × 106/mL, or motility < 40%. Among couples whose male partner had low TT, 21 (18.8%) had a live birth, compared with 184 (27.5%) live births in couples with a male partner having TT > 264 ng/dL. The odds of live birth decreased by 40% in couples whose male partner had low TT (unadjusted OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.36, 1.00; adjusted OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.38, 1.12). CONCLUSION(S): In couples with unexplained infertility, low TT in the male partner was associated with abnormal sperm morphology and lower live birth rates.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Timely review of research protocols by institutional review boards leads to more rapid initiation of clinical trials, which is critical to expeditious translation from bench to bedside. This observational study examined the impact of a single institutional review board on time and efforts required to initiate clinical trials by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Cooperative Reproductive Medicine Network. METHODS: Collection of data from the same six main clinical sites for three current clinical trials and two past clinical trials, including time from institutional review board submission to approval, pages submitted, consent form length, number of required attachments, other regulatory requirements, order of review at central or local sites, and language in documents at individual participating sites. Results from two past clinical trials were also included. RESULTS: While time required for actual institutional review board submission's review and initial approval was reduced with use of a single institutional review board for multicenter trials (from a mean of 66.7-24.0 days), total time was increased (to a mean of 111.2 or 123.3 days). In addition to single institutional review board approval, all institutions required local approval of some components (commonly consent language and use of local language), which varied considerably. The single institutional review board relied on local institutions for adding or removing personnel, conflict of interest review, and auditing of activities. CONCLUSION: A single institutional review board reduced time for initial review and approval of protocols and informed consents, although time for the entire process was increased, as individual institutions retained oversight of components of required regulatory review. In order to best achieve the National Institute of Health's goals for improved efficiency in initiation and conduct of multisite clinical research, greater coordination with local institutional review boards is key to streamlining and accelerating initiation of multisite clinical research.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), a marker of ovarian reserve, declines over a woman's reproductive lifespan. AMH is highly correlated with a woman's age and number of primordial ovarian follicles, and has been shown to predict time to menopause in women in their 40s. For these reasons, it was assumed that AMH levels could predict a woman's reproductive potential or serve as a 'fertility test'. Recently, studies have sought to determine the association between AMH and fertility. RECENT FINDINGS: Although a small, prospective, time-to-pregnancy study of 98 women suggested that an AMH level less than 0.7 ng/ml was associated with lower day-specific probabilities of conception, the follow-up, larger cohort did not identify an association with AMH and fecundability. Women with AMH values less than 0.7 ng/ml had similar pregnancy rates after 12 cycles of attempting to conceive as women with normal AMH values after adjusting for age. Four additional studies, including a secondary analysis of the NICHD EAGER trial including over 1200 women confirmed these findings. SUMMARY: Although AMH is a marker of ovarian reserve, existing literature does not support the use of AMH as a marker of reproductive potential in the general population.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the extent to which lubricant use during intercourse is associated with time to pregnancy (TTP). DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Denmark and North America. POPULATION: A total of 6467 women aged 18-49 years who were not using contraception or fertility treatment. METHODS: We pooled data from two continuing prospective cohort studies of pregnancy planners in Denmark (2011-2017) and North America (2013-2017). Female participants completed bimonthly questionnaires for 12 months or until they reported pregnancy. After restricting the study to women without a history of infertility who had been trying to conceive for six or fewer cycles at enrollment, 6467 women were retained for analysis. Self-reported lubricant use was categorised as water-based/not pH balanced, water-based/pH balanced 'fertility friendly', silicone-based, oil-based, or a combination of these. We used proportional probability models to calculate fecundability ratios (FRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the association between lubricant use and fecundability, after adjusting for cohort and sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Fecundability. RESULTS: At baseline, 17.5% of participants reported the use of lubricants, most commonly water-based/not pH balanced (11.4%). Compared with non-use of lubricants, FRs were 1.02 (95% CI 0.93-1.11) for water-based/not pH-balanced lubricant use, 1.01 (95% CI 0.86-1.18) for water-based/pH balanced 'fertility friendly' lubricant use, 1.23 (95% CI 0.94-1.61) for oil-based lubricant use, and 1.27 (95% CI 0.93-1.73) for silicone-based lubricant use. Associations between oil-based lubricant use and fecundability were inconsistent across subgroups of study cohort, age, parity, and intercourse frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Lubricant use was not associated with reduced fecundability in the preconception cohorts of pregnancy planners studied. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Lubricant use during intercourse was not associated with time to pregnancy in a study of pregnancy planners.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to examine the associations between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and biomarkers of ovarian reserve in a large community-based sample of women. METHODS: In 2010 to 2016, women aged 30 to 44 years without any known fertility problems were recruited from the Chapel Hill, NC area for a prospective time-to-pregnancy cohort study. At enrollment 561 women provided a blood sample that was used to measure 25(OH)D, anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), follicle-stimulating hormone, and inhibin-B. Unadjusted associations were estimated with Spearman correlation coefficients. Multivariable linear regression was used to estimate associations of 25(OH)D with ovarian reserve biomarkers, after adjusting for age, race, body mass index, smoking history, and recent use of hormonal birth control. RESULTS: The mean 25(OH)D was 36 ng/mL (SD = 11 ng/mL). 25(OH)D was not correlated with AMH, follicle-stimulating hormone, or inhibin-B (all r < 0.03). Multivariable results with continuous hormonal outcomes were also null. For dichotomous outcomes, there was a tendency for insufficient 25(OH)D (<30 ng/mL) to be associated with low AMH (<0.7 ng/mL) (odds ratio [95% CI]: 1.8 [0.9-4]). CONCLUSIONS: For the most part, 25(OH)D was not associated with ovarian reserve biomarkers in a group of women trying to become pregnant. We found some evidence that low 25(OH)D (<30 ng/mL) was associated with low AMH, but this should be confirmed in studies with a higher prevalence of low 25(OH)D.",

        "abstract": "STUDY QUESTION: Are anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels assessed in women aged 32-44 associated with risk of incident early natural menopause? SUMMARY ANSWER: We observed strong, significant associations between lower AMH levels and higher risk of early menopause. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The ability to predict risk early menopause, defined as menopause before age 45, prior to fertility decline would improve options for family planning and cardiovascular disease prevention. Though AMH is an established marker of menopause timing in older reproductive-aged women, whether AMH is associated with risk of early menopause has not been evaluated. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We assessed these relations in a nested case-control study within the prospective Nurses' Health Study II cohort. Premenopausal blood samples were collected in 1996-1999. Participants were followed until 2011 for early natural menopause, with follow-up rates >94%. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Early menopause cases (n = 327) were women reporting natural menopause between blood collection and age 45. Controls (n = 491) experienced menopause after age 45 and included 327 cases matched to controls on the basis of age at blood draw (±4 months) and other factors. AMH levels up to 12 years before early menopause were assayed in 2016. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In multivariable conditional logistic regression models adjusting for matching factors, body mass index, smoking, parity, oral contraceptive use, and other factors, each 0.10 ng/ml decrease in AMH was associated with a 14% higher risk of early menopause (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10 to 1.18; P < 0.001). In polynomial regression models including linear and quadratic terms for AMH, odds ratios for early menopause for women with AMH levels of 1.5, 1.0 and 0.5 ng/ml compared to 2.0 ng/ml were 2.6, 7.5 and 23 (all P < 0.001). Significant associations were observed irrespective of smoking status, adiposity, infertility history and menstrual cycle characteristics. Furthermore, models assessing the predictive ability of AMH showed high concordance, and C-statistics were high, ranging from 0.68 (age ≤35) to 0.93 (age 42). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Our population was relatively homogenous with respect to race/ethnicity. Further work in more ethnically diverse populations is needed. WIDE IMPLICATION OF THE FINDINGS: To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to evaluate whether AMH levels are associated with early menopause. These findings support the utility of AMH as a clinical marker of early menopause in otherwise healthy women. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This project was supported by UM1CA176726, R01CA67262, and R01HD078517 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health.

DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Clinics. PATIENT(S): Participants in two randomized trials: PPCOS II (clomiphene citrate versus letrozole for polycystic ovary syndrome), and AMIGOS (gonadotropins versus clomiphene citrate versus letrozole for unexplained infertility). INTERVENTION(S): Female and male partners completed the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Female medication use was collected. PHQ-9 score ≥10 was used to define currently active MD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Primary outcome: live birth. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: pregnancy, first-trimester miscarriage. Poisson regression models were used to determine relative risks after adjusting for age, race, income, months trying to conceive, smoking, and study (PPCOS II versus AMIGOS). RESULT(S): Data for 1,650 women and 1,608 men were included. Among women not using an antidepressant, the presence of currently active MD was not associated with poorer fertility outcomes (live birth, miscarriage), but rather was associated with a slightly increased likelihood of pregnancy. Maternal antidepressant use (n = 90) was associated with increased risk of miscarriage, and male partners with currently active MD were less likely to achieve conception. CONCLUSION(S): Currently active MD in the female partner does not negatively affect non-IVF treatment outcomes; however, currently active MD in the male partner may lower the likelihood of pregnancy. Maternal antidepressant use is associated with first-trimester pregnancy loss, which may depend upon the type of antidepressant. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBERS: NCT00719186 and NCT01044862.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vitamin D insufficiency is associated with subfertility and prolonged estrus cycles in animals, but humans have not been well studied. METHODS: A prospective time-to-pregnancy study, Time to Conceive (2010-2015), collected up to 4 months of daily diary data. Participants were healthy, late reproductive-aged women in North Carolina who were attempting pregnancy. We examined menstrual cycle length as a continuous variable and in categories: long (35+ days) and short (≤25 days). Follicular phase length and luteal phase length were categorized as long (18+ days) or short (≤10 days). We estimated associations between those lengths and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) using linear mixed models and marginal models. RESULTS: There were 1,278 menstrual cycles from 446 women of whom 5% were vitamin D deficient (25[OH]D, <20 ng/ml), 69% were between 20 and 39 ng/ml, and 26% were 40 ng/ml or higher. There was a dose-response association between vitamin D levels and cycle length. Compared with the highest 25(OH)D level (≥40 ng/ml), 25(OH)D deficiency was associated with almost three times the odds of long cycles (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.8 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.0, 7.5]). The aOR was 1.9 (1.1, 3.5) for 20 to <30 ng/ml. The probability of a long follicular phase and the probability of a short luteal phase both increased with decreasing 25(OH)D. CONCLUSIONS: Lower levels of 25(OH)D are associated with longer follicular phase and an overall longer menstrual cycle. Our results are consistent with other evidence supporting vitamin D's role in the reproductive axis, which may have broader implications for reproductive success.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the optimal criteria at which to start GnRH antagonists during controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) for in vitro fertilization (IVF). DESIGN: Retrospective clinical cohort. SETTING: IVF clinics. PATIENT(S): Women undergoing fresh autologous IVF using GnRH antagonist for ovulation suppression during COH. INTERVENTION(S): Measurement of lead follicle size, E2 level, and cycle day of stimulation on day of antagonist initiation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Clinical pregnancy rate (PR). RESULT(S): The highest clinical PR was achieved when the antagonist was started when a lead follicle reached 14-15.9 mm in size (mean clinical PR 21.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] 19.3, 23.6) on cycle day 6 (mean clinical PR 22.2; 95% CI 17, 28.4), or when the E2 level was between 500 and 599 pg/mL (mean clinical PR 25.4; 95% CI 19.5, 32.4). Starting antagonists when the E2 level was <300 or >1,100 pg/mL reduced the odds of clinical pregnancy by 40% (odds ratio 0.60, 95% CI 0.5, 0.7). CONCLUSION(S): Cycle day, E2 level, and follicle size at time of antagonist start are all independent predictors of a clinical pregnancy after IVF. Initiating antagonists when the E2 level is extremely low (<300 pg/mL) or extremely high (>1,100 pg/mL) significantly reduces the odds of pregnancy.",

DESIGN: Secondary analysis of data from two multicenter, randomized, controlled trials conducted by the Reproductive Medicine Network of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between preconceptual TSH levels and anti-TPO antibodies. SETTING: Not applicable. PATIENT(S): Serum samples from 1,468 infertile women were utilized. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Cumulative conception, clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, and live birth rates were calculated. RESULT(S): Conception, clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, and live birth rates did not differ between patients with TSH ≥2.5 mIU/L vs. TSH < 2.5 mIU/L. Women with anti-TPO antibodies had similar conception rates (33.3% vs. 36.3%) but higher miscarriage rates (43.9% vs. 25.3%) and lower live birth rates (17.1% vs. 25.4%) than those without anti-TPO antibodies. Adjusted, multivariable logistic regression models confirmed elevated odds of miscarriage (odds ratio 2.17, 95% confidence interval 1.12-4.22) and lower odds of live birth (oddr ratio 0.58, 95% confidence interval 0.35-0.96) in patients with anti-TPO antibodies. CONCLUSION(S): In infertile women, preconceptional TSH ≥2.5 mIU/L is not associated with adverse reproductive outcomes; however, anti-TPO antibodies are associated with increased risk of miscarriage and decreased probability of live birth.

        "abstract": "Importance: Despite lack of evidence of their utility, biomarkers of ovarian reserve are being promoted as potential markers of reproductive potential. Objective: To determine the associations between biomarkers of ovarian reserve and reproductive potential among women of late reproductive age. Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective time-to-pregnancy cohort study (2008 to date of last follow-up in March 2016) of women (N = 981) aged 30 to 44 years without a history of infertility who had been trying to conceive for 3 months or less, recruited from the community in the Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, area. Exposures: Early-follicular-phase serum level of antimüllerian hormone (AMH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and inhibin B and urinary level of FSH. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were the cumulative probability of conception by 6 and 12 cycles of attempt and relative fecundability (probability of conception in a given menstrual cycle). Conception was defined as a positive pregnancy test result. Results: A total of 750 women (mean age, 33.3 [SD, 3.2] years; 77% white; 36% overweight or obese) provided a blood and urine sample and were included in the analysis. After adjusting for age, body mass index, race, current smoking status, and recent hormonal contraceptive use, women with low AMH values (<0.7 ng/mL [n = 84]) did not have a significantly different predicted probability of conceiving by 6 cycles of attempt (65%; 95% CI, 50%-75%) compared with women (n = 579) with normal values (62%; 95% CI, 57%-66%) or by 12 cycles of attempt (84% [95% CI, 70%-91%] vs 75% [95% CI, 70%-79%], respectively). Women with high serum FSH values (>10 mIU/mL [n = 83]) did not have a significantly different predicted probability of conceiving after 6 cycles of attempt (63%; 95% CI, 50%-73%) compared with women (n = 654) with normal values (62%; 95% CI, 57%-66%) or after 12 cycles of attempt (82% [95% CI, 70%-89%] vs 75% [95% CI, 70%-78%], respectively). Women with high urinary FSH values (>11.5 mIU/mg creatinine [n = 69]) did not have a significantly different predicted probability of conceiving after 6 cycles of attempt (61%; 95% CI, 46%-74%) compared with women (n = 660) with normal values (62%; 95% CI, 58%-66%) or after 12 cycles of attempt (70% [95% CI, 54%-80%] vs 76% [95% CI, 72%-80%], respectively). Inhibin B levels (n = 737) were not associated with the probability of conceiving in a given cycle (hazard ratio per 1-pg/mL increase, 0.999; 95% CI, 0.997-1.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Among women aged 30 to 44 years without a history of infertility who had been trying to conceive for 3 months or less, biomarkers indicating diminished ovarian reserve compared with normal ovarian reserve were not associated with reduced fertility. These findings do not support the use of urinary or blood follicle-stimulating hormone tests or antimüllerian hormone levels to assess natural fertility for women with these characteristics.",

        "abstract": "STUDY QUESTION: What is the live-birth rate (LBR) and cost-effectiveness of fertility preservation with oocyte cryopreservation (FP-OC) compared to expectant management in cancer patients age 25-40 based on estimated gonadotoxicity of treatments 5 years after cancer diagnosis? SUMMARY ANSWER: Oocyte cryopreservation prior to cancer treatment is more costly, yet more effective (producing more live births), than not undergoing oocyte cryopreservation but it is most beneficial for patients undergoing high-risk chemotherapy (HRC). WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The decision to undergo FP prior to treatment is multifactorial and can be costly and delay treatment. Not all treatments carry the same gonadotoxicity and patients may choose to undergo FP-OC based on the probability of premature ovarian insufficiency, predicted outcomes and cost. A comprehensive model that incorporates age at diagnosis and toxicity of treatment to help guide patients in the decision to undergo FP-OC does not yet exist. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE DURATION: This study used a Decision Analysis Model to estimate effectiveness and cost of FP for cancer patients. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Age-based estimates of LBR and cost per live birth were calculated for ages 25-40 years based on gonadotoxicity of treatment. A decision analysis model was constructed using Treeage Pro 2015 with case base probabilities derived from national registries, practice guidelines and medical records from a national network of infertility practices (IntegraMed). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Compared to no FP-OC, FP-OC improved LBRs for women of all ages undergoing either low-risk chemotherapy (LRC) or HRC; however, it was most cost effective for women undergoing LRC at older ages or HRC at younger ages. Although FP-OC results in higher LBRs, it was always more costly. Using donor oocyte IVF can be a successful alternative to autologous FP-OC. LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: Decision tree results reflect probabilities of certain events and are compiled from multiple reputable sources but are not directly derived from a recruited cohort of patients. Outcomes are based on United States estimates and should be interpreted in the broader context of individual patient diagnoses, treatment care plans and country of origin. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The development of this analytic model will help guide practitioners in their counseling of women from age 25 to 40 years, who are considering FP-OC at the time of cancer diagnosis. It provides a realistic pathway from diagnosis to LB and accounts for the majority of costs and outcome possibilities.

        "abstract": "The aim of this study is to report a case of acute ureterovaginal fistula (UVF) formation with immediate symptomatic presentation after transvaginal ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval (TVOR) for in vitro fertilization (IVF) and to perform a systematic literature review of ureteral injuries during TVOR. A 33-year-old woman with a history of anovulatory infertility presented with severe abdominal pain and vaginal leakage immediately following TVOR for IVF. We systematically reviewed the current literature regarding ureteral injury resulting from TVOR and present a case of timely identification and management of a UVF followed by a successful pregnancy. Computed tomography cystogram with intravenous contrast and left retrograde pyelogram confirmed the diagnosis of UVF which was managed by placement of the left ureteral stent. The IVF cycle was converted to a freeze-all cycle. The ureteral stent was removed 4 weeks later, and a subsequent frozen embryo transfer cycle resulted in pregnancy. We present the 13th case of ureteral injury and the fourth case of UVF following TVOR. UVF formation is a rare complication after TVOR and may result in serious long-term morbidity if it is not identified and treated promptly. Clinicians must exercise a high degree of suspicion and prompt evaluation for potential ureteral injuries in women presenting with abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, or vaginal leakage following TVOR.",

        "abstract": "Perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) can act as endocrine-disrupting chemicals, but there has been limited study of their effects on ovarian reserve or fecundability. 99 women, 30-44 years old, without infertility were followed until pregnancy. Initially, serum was evaluated for Antimullerian hormone (AMH), thyroid hormones: thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroxine (T4), free thyroxine (fT4), and triiodothyronine (T3), and PFCs: perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS). Bivariate analyses assessed the relationship between thyroid hormones, AMH, and PFCs. Fecundability ratios (FR) were determined for each PFC using a discrete time-varying Cox model and a day-specific probability model. PFC levels were positively correlated with each other (r 0.24-0.90), but there was no correlation with TSH (r 0.02-0.15) or AMH (r -0.01 to -0.15). FR point estimates for each PFC were neither strong nor statistically significant. Although increased exposure to PFCs correlates with thyroid hormone levels, there is no significant association with fecundability or ovarian reserve.",

PATIENT(S): Women trying to conceive, ages 30-44 years, without known infertility. INTERVENTION(S): Daily diaries, ovulation prediction testing, standardized pregnancy testing. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Subsequent cycle fecundity. RESULT(S): Included in the analysis were 1,635 cycles from 284 women. A short luteal phase (≤11 days including the day of ovulation) occurred in 18% of observed cycles. Mean luteal phase length was 14 days. Significantly more women with a short luteal phase were smokers. After adjustment for age, women with a short luteal phase had 0.82 times the odds of pregnancy in the subsequent cycle immediately following the short luteal phase compared with women without a short luteal phase. Women with a short luteal length in the first observed cycle had significantly lower fertility after the first 6 months of pregnancy attempt, but at 12 months there was no significant difference in cumulative probability of pregnancy. CONCLUSION(S): Although an isolated cycle with a short luteal phase may negatively affect short-term fertility, incidence of infertility at 12 months was not significantly higher among these women.

Thyroid autoimmunity is the leading cause of thyroid dysfunction in women of reproductive age. Women with thyroid autoimmunity, even with normal thyroid function, appear to be at a higher risk for poor reproductive outcomes, including miscarriage and preterm birth.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Information on the effects of different pharmaceuticals on fertility is sparse. Human and animal models indicate that antidepressant use could have a negative effect on fertility through alteration of levels of the neurosteroid, allopregnanolone. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to assess the effects of antidepressants on the natural fertility in women. STUDY DESIGN: A secondary analysis of data from Time to Conceive, a prospective cohort study, was conducted. Women ages 30 to 44 years without a history of infertility, early in their attempts to conceive, were followed with standardized pregnancy testing until pregnancy was detected. Medication use was assessed at enrollment, daily for up to 4 months, and then monthly. For this analysis, discrete time regression models were created to calculate the association between antidepressant use and fecundability. Potential confounders-age, body mass index, caffeine, alcohol use, and education-were included in all models. RESULTS: Ninety-two (9.6%) of 957 women reported antidepressant use while attempting to conceive. Women taking antidepressants were more likely to be non-Hispanic Caucasian (91% vs 75%, P < .01) and to consume alcoholic beverages (74% vs 61%, P < .01). Antidepressant use at enrollment had an adjusted fecundability ratio (FR) of 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63-1.20). However, time-varying analyses suggested that antidepressant use in a given cycle is associated with a reduced probability of conceiving in that cycle (adjusted FR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.53-1.06). After adjusting for history of depression or restricting the analysis to women who reported a history of depression, the association between antidepressant use and decreased fecundability remained [adjusted FR, 0.66 (95% CI, 0.45-0.97) and (adjusted FR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.43-0.94), respectively]. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that antidepressants may reduce the probability of a woman with a history of depression to conceive naturally. Future studies are needed to differentiate the extent to which this association is due to the antidepressant itself versus the underlying depression.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) reduces aromatase activity and sensitivity of follicles to FSH stimulation. Therefore, elevated serum AMH may indicate a higher threshold for response to ovulation induction in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine the association between AMH levels and ovulatory response to treatment among the women enrolled into the Pregnancy in PCOS II (PPCOS II) trial. DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a secondary analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial in academic health centers throughout the United States Participants: A total of 748 women age 18-40 years, with PCOS and measured AMH levels at baseline, were included in this study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Couples were followed for up to five treatment cycles to determine ovulation (midluteal serum progesterone > 5 ng/mL) and the dose required to achieve ovulation. RESULTS: A lower mean AMH and AMH per follicle was observed among women who ovulated compared with women who never achieved ovulation during the study (geometric mean AMH, 5.54 vs 7.35 ng/mL; P = .0001; geometric mean AMH per follicle, 0.14 vs 0.18; P = .01) after adjustment for age, body mass index, T, and insulin level. As AMH levels increased, the dose of ovulation induction medication needed to achieve ovulation also increased. No associations were observed between antral follicle count and ovulation. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that high serum AMH is associated with a reduced response to ovulation induction among women with PCOS. Women with higher AMH levels may require higher doses of medication to achieve ovulation.",

INTERVENTION(S): Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Fecundability and incidence of infertility. RESULT(S): Compared to women aged 30-31 years, fecundability was reduced by 14% in women 34-35 years of age (fecundability ratio [FR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-1.08), 19% in women 36-37 years of age (FR 0.81, 95% CI 0.60-1.08, 30% in women 38-39 years of age (FR 0.70, 95% CI 0.48-1.01), 53% in women 40-41 years of age (FR 0.47, 95% CI 0.28-0.78), and 59% in women 42-44 years of age (FR 0.39, 95% CI 0.16-0.93).

DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Outpatient clinics. PATIENT(S): In all, 1,250 infertile women with documented tubal patency enrolled in 1 of 2 randomized controlled trials: Pregnancy in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome II; and the Assessment of Multiple Intrauterine Gestations From Ovarian Stimulation. INTERVENTION(S): Sera were analyzed for anti-C. trachomatis immunoglobulin G (IgG)1 and IgG3 antibodies, using a research C. trachomatis EB ELISA. The optical density (OD)405 readings of ≥ 0.35 and ≥ 0.1 were considered positive for IgG1 and IgG3, respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Primary outcomes included pregnancy, live birth, and ectopic pregnancy. Log-linear regression was used to determine the relative risk after adjusting for age, race, treatment medication, smoking status, and current alcohol use. RESULT(S): A total of 243 (19%) women were seropositive for anti-C. trachomatis IgG3. They tended to be nonwhite and smokers. Anti-C. trachomatis IgG3 seropositive women were significantly less likely to conceive (risk ratio [RR] 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52-0.83) or to have a live birth (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.43-0.80); these associations were weakened after adjusting for number of hysterosalpingography-documented patent tubes (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.56-0.97) and (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.50-1.04), respectively. Anti-C. trachomatis IgG3 seropositive women who conceived had a ×2.7 risk (95% CI 1.40-5.34) of ectopic pregnancy. CONCLUSION(S): Even in the presence of tubal patency, anti-C. trachomatis IgG3 seropositivity is associated with a lower likelihood of pregnancy. Anti-C. trachomatis IgG3 seropositive women have as high as 3 times the risk of ectopic pregnancy. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: PPCOSII: NCT00719186 and AMIGOS: NCT01044862.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To estimate the optimal age to pursue elective oocyte cryopreservation. DESIGN: A decision-tree model was constructed to determine the success and cost-effectiveness of oocyte preservation versus no action when considered at ages 25-40 years, assuming an attempt at procreation 3, 5, or 7 years after initial decision. SETTING: Not applicable. PATIENT(S): Hypothetical patients 25-40 years old presenting to discuss elective oocyte cryopreservation. INTERVENTION(S): Decision to cryopreserve oocytes from age 25 years to age 40 years versus taking no action. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE(S): Probability of live birth after initial decision whether or not to cryopreserve oocytes. RESULT(S): Oocyte cryopreservation provided the greatest improvement in probability of live birth compared with no action (51.6% vs. 21.9%) when performed at age 37 years. The highest probability of live birth was seen when oocyte cryopreservation was performed at ages <34 years (>74%), although little benefit over no action was seen at ages 25-30 years (2.6%-7.1% increase). Oocyte cryopreservation was most cost-effective at age 37 years, at $28,759 per each additional live birth in the oocyte cryopreservation group. When the probability of marriage was included, oocyte cryopreservation resulted in little improvement in live birth rates. CONCLUSION(S): Oocyte cryopreservation can be of great benefit to specific women and has the highest chance of success when performed at an earlier age. At age 37 years, oocyte cryopreservation has the largest benefit over no action and is most cost-effective.",

Human studies are lacking; one study (N = 105 cases, 204 controls) with prospectively collected serum reported the opposite-an approximate 10-fold increase in breast cancer risk comparing fourth with first quartile AMH levels. We investigated the relation between serum AMH levels and breast cancer risk in a case-control (N = 452 cases, 902 controls) study nested within the prospective Sister Study cohort of 50,884 women. At enrollment, participants were ages 35 to 54, premenopausal, and completed questionnaires on medical and family history, lifestyle factors, and demographics. AMH (ng/mL) was measured by ultrasensitive ELISA in serum collected at enrollment and log-transformed for analysis. Multivariate conditional logistic regression was used to calculate ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to account for matching on age and enrollment year. Mean age at enrollment was 46.8 years with an average 2.9 years from blood draw to breast cancer diagnosis (SD = 1.9). AMH concentrations were below the limit of detection (0.003 ng/mL) for approximately 25% of samples. Compared with samples below the LOD, women with AMH >2.84 ng/mL (90th percentile among controls) had a 2-fold increase in breast cancer odds (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.26-4.02). For each 1-unit increase in lnAMH, overall breast cancer odds increased by 8% (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-1.15) and odds of estrogen receptor-positive, invasive disease increased by 15% (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.05-1.25). Our findings demonstrate an overall positive relation between AMH and breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Few data exist regarding anti-Müllerian hormone, a marker of ovarian reserve, in relation to environmental factors with potential ovarian toxicity. METHODS: This analysis included 420 women from Limpopo, South Africa studied in 2010-2011. Women were administered comprehensive questionnaires, and plasma concentrations of anti-Müllerian hormone and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane were determined. We used separate multivariable models to examine the associations between natural log-transformed anti-Müllerian hormone concentration (ng/ml) and each of the lifestyle, reproductive, and environmental factors of interest, adjusted for age, body mass index, education, and parity. RESULTS: The median age of women was 24 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 22 to 26); the median anti-Müllerian hormone concentration was 3.1 ng/ml (IQR = 2.0 to 6.0). Women who reported indoor residual spraying in homes with painted walls (indicative of exposure to pyrethroids) had 25% lower (95% confidence interval [CI] = -39%, -8%) anti-Müllerian hormone concentrations compared with women who reported no spraying. Little evidence of decreased anti-Müllerian hormone concentrations was observed among women with the highest dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane levels. Compared with women who used an electric stove, no association was observed among women who cooked indoors over open wood fires. The findings also suggested lower anti-Müllerian hormone concentrations among women who drank coffee (-19% [95% CI = -31%, -5%]) or alcohol (-21% [95% CI = -36%, -3%]). CONCLUSIONS: These are among the first data regarding anti-Müllerian hormone concentrations relative to pesticides and indoor air pollution. Our results are suggestive of decreased ovarian reserve associated with exposure to pyrethroid pesticides, which is consistent with laboratory animal data.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In animals, low levels of vitamin D are associated with estrus cycle disturbances, but there are virtually no human data. We examined the association of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) (a biomarker for vitamin D status) with menstrual cycle characteristics. METHODS: Women aged 35-44 were randomly selected from a Washington D.C. health plan and invited to participate in the Uterine Fibroid Study (1996-1999). Our analysis includes 636 women (57% were African-American) who provided a blood sample and completed a telephone interview that included gynecologic history. Women were asked their usual cycle length in the preceding year. Women who reported it was \"too irregular to estimate\" were classified as having irregular cycles (N=48). Women were excluded if they currently or recently used hormonal contraception or any other medication that influences menstrual cycles. 25(OH)D was measured by radioimmunoassay in stored plasma samples. RESULTS: The median 25(OH)D level was 12.0 ng/mL (interquartile range: 7.6, 19.7 ng/mL). After controlling for age, race, BMI, education, age of menarche, current smoking, alcohol use, and physical activity, a decrease in 25(OH)D of 10 ng/mL was associated with 1.9 times the odds of irregular cycles (Odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)): 1.9 (1.0, 3.4), p=0.04). 25(OH)D was not associated with the occurrence of short cycles (OR(CI): 1.08 (0.79, 1.48, p=0.6) or long cycles (OR(CI): 1.31 (0.66, 2.60), p=0.4). CONCLUSIONS: Lower levels of 25(OH)D were associated with irregular cycles, but not with short or long cycles. Vitamin D may play a role in regulating ovulatory function. Further investigation of potential mechanisms is warranted.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Vitamin D has been linked to antimüllerian hormone levels, suggesting a possible association with greater ovarian reserve, but large population-based studies are lacking. Our objective was to explore the association between vitamin D and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in premenopausal women. METHODS: The Uterine Fibroid Study (1996-1999) enrolled randomly selected 30- to 49-year-old members of a Washington, DC, health plan (N = 1,430). Women provided blood and urine samples in addition to questionnaire data. The vitamin D metabolite 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) was measured in stored plasma samples. Urinary FSH (mIU/mg creatinine) was measured by immunofluorometric assay. To obtain baseline measures, we limited this investigation to urine samples collected in the first 5 days of the menstrual cycle or 5 days before menses onset. In addition, postmenopausal women and women using oral contraceptives were excluded, leaving 527 women for analysis. FSH was creatinine-adjusted, normalized by log transformation, and modeled with multivariable linear regression. RESULTS: The median 25(OH)D level was 12 ng/mL, with approximately 75% of participants below the recommended level of 20 ng/mL. FSH and 25(OH)D were inversely related. For every 10-ng/mL increase in 25(OH)D, urinary FSH decreased by 14% (95% CI, -23 to -5; P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D is inversely related to FSH. This is consistent with literature relating low vitamin D levels to lower antimüllerian hormone levels. Prospective studies should investigate whether low vitamin D levels contribute to decreased ovarian reserve.",

DESIGN: Time-to-pregnancy cohort using day-specific probability of pregnancy modeling to account for intercourse during the fertile window. SETTING: Community cohort. PATIENT(S): Women trying to conceive naturally, ages 30-44, without known infertility. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Positive pregnancy test. RESULT(S): A total of 564 women provided 1,332 complete cycles for analysis. Intercourse frequency during the fertile window and during the peri-implantation window were significantly correlated. Cycles in which couples had 2 or more days with intercourse during the implantation window were significantly less likely to result in a positive pregnancy test compared with cycles in which couples did not have intercourse in this window, after adjusting for age, race, history of regular menstrual cycles, previous pregnancy, and body mass index (fecundability ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.42-0.91). CONCLUSION(S): Intercourse during the peri-implantation window may be detrimental to natural fertility.

The aim of this review is to summarize the current in-vitro and clinical data pertaining to lubricants' effect on natural conception. RECENT FINDINGS: In-vitro studies suggest lubricants can be toxic to sperm in the artificial laboratory environment. Lubricants formulated to be nontoxic to sperm have no effect on sperm motility or viability in vitro compared to controls. However, a recent longitudinal cohort study suggests lubricant use and choice has no effect of fecundity. SUMMARY: As a result of the conflicting in-vitro and clinical data, the effect of vaginal lubricants on fertility is still unresolved. A randomized controlled trial is needed to determine the effects of vaginal lubricants on fertility.",

RESULT(S): Based on self-reported past year physical activity, the adjusted odds of intrauterine gestation was higher among those that had higher continuous active living (odds ratio [OR] 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09-3.50), sports/exercise (OR 1.48, CI 1.02-2.15), and total activity (OR 1.52, 95%CI 1.15-2.01) indices. After embryo transfer, women did almost no vigorous activity (median 0 min/d) as measured by the accelerometer. More of their time was spent in light activity (median 3.0 h/d) and sedentary behaviors (median 9.3 h/d). Accelerometer-measured physical activity and sedentary behavior after embryo transfer were not associated with any IVF outcome. CONCLUSION(S): An active lifestyle in the preceding year favorably impacted the IVF outcome. After embryo transfer, women engaged in mostly light physical activity and sedentary behaviors; therefore, the impact of vigorous physical activity on implantation could not be determined.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the short-term effects of salpingectomy during laparoscopic hysterectomy on ovarian reserve when ovarian preservation is planned in view of determining the feasibility of conducting the study on a larger scale. DESIGN: Pilot randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Tertiary care, academic medical center. PATIENT(S): Thirty premenopausal women aged 18 to 45 years undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy with ovarian preservation for benign indications from April 2012 to September 2012. INTERVENTION(S): Bilateral salpingectomy (n = 15) versus no salpingectomy (n = 15) at the time of laparoscopic hysterectomy with ovarian preservation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Antimüllerian hormone (AMH) measured preoperatively, at 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively, and at 3 months postoperatively, with operative time and estimated blood loss abstracted from the medical records. RESULT(S): The mean AMH levels were not statistically significantly different at baseline (2.26 vs. 2.25 ng/ml), 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively (1.03 vs. 1.25 ng/ml), or 3 months postoperatively (1.86 vs. 1.82 ng/ml) among women with salpingectomy versus no salpingectomy, respectively. There was also no statistically significant temporal change in the mean AMH level from baseline to 3 months postoperatively (-0.07 vs. -0.08 ng/ml) between the two groups. No difference in operative time (116 vs. 115 minutes) or estimated blood loss (70 vs. 91 mL) was observed. CONCLUSION(S): Salpingectomy at the time of laparoscopic hysterectomy with ovarian preservation is a safe procedure that does not appear to have any short-term deleterious effects on ovarian reserve, as measured by AMH level. Conducting a trial of this nature that is adequately powered with long-term follow-up evaluation would be feasible and is required to definitively confirm these results.",

        "abstract": "The size of the oocyte pool, the ovarian reserve, can determine a woman's reproductive stage. Chronologic age, anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels, early follicular phase follicle-stimulating hormone levels, and early follicular phase inhibin B levels are correlated with ovarian reserve. Therefore, these biomarkers of ovarian reserve should serve as predictors of reproductive potential. Clinical and epidemiologic studies suggest that historical and laboratory biomarkers of ovarian reserve are associated with natural and treatment-related fertility. However, controversy remains as to their ability to predict reproductive potential. For infertile women undergoing assisted reproductive technology treatment, these biomarkers tend to be highly specific but not sensitive for cycle failure (nonpregnancy). While these biomarkers are being used as \"fertility tests\" in the general population, their value as predictors of unassisted fertility is still uncertain. Among laboratory biomarkers, AMH appears to have the most promise; however, further studies are needed to refine cutoff values and to determine test characteristics in the prediction of natural fertility or infertility in the general population.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the use of cervical mucus monitoring (CMM) in women trying to conceive and determine whether monitoring is associated with increased cycle-specific probability of conception (fecundability). DESIGN: Time-to-pregnancy cohort study. SETTING: Population-based cohort. PATIENT(S): Three hundred thirty-one women trying to conceive, ages 30 to 44 years, without known infertility. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): CMM prevalence and fecundability. RESULT(S): During the first cycle of the study, CMM was performed consistently (checked on >66% of pertinent cycle days) by 20 women (6%), inconsistently (34% to 66% of days) by 60 women (18%), infrequently (≤33% of days) by 73 women (22%), and not performed by 178 women (54%). Cycles in which CMM was consistently performed were statistically significantly more likely to result in conception after adjusting for age, race, previous pregnancy, body mass index, intercourse frequency, and urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) monitoring. Fecundability also increased with increasing consistency of CMM. CONCLUSION(S): Among women trying to conceive, CMM is uncommon, but our study suggests that CMM-a free, self-directed method to determine the fertile window-is associated with increased fecundability independent of intercourse frequency or use of urinary LH monitoring.",

        "abstract": "High serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels have been associated with diminished ovarian reserve; however, the association between high urinary FSH and reduced natural fertility has yet to be established. We sought to characterize the relationship between a single or multiple measurements of early follicular phase urinary FSH and fertility. Women (n = 209), 30 to 44 years old with no history of infertility, who had been trying to conceive for less than 3 months, provided early follicular phase urine. Participants subsequently kept a diary to record bleeding and intercourse and conducted standardized pregnancy testing for up to 6 months. A subset of women (N = 95) collected urine on cycle day 3 for up to 6 cycles. Urine was analyzed for FSH and creatinine (cr) corrected. Proportional hazard models were used to calculate fecundability ratios (FRs). Urinary FSH levels across cycles from the same woman were highly correlated (adjusted intraclass correlation = .77); within-woman variance was 3-fold lower than variance among women. Women with an initial urinary FSH level <7 mIU/mg cr exhibited a nonsignificant reduction in the probability of pregnancy (adjusted FR 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.45-1.13), as did women with elevated urinary FSH (≥12 mIU/mg cr; adjusted FR 0.78, 95% CI: 0.46-1.32). Using the most recent or maximum urinary FSH value did not strengthen the association. In the general population, urinary FSH levels appear to be nonlinearly associated with fertility; however, broad CIs indicate a lack of statistical significance. Repetitive testing appears to be of little benefit.",

        "abstract": "Young women with breast cancer face treatments that impair ovarian function, but it is not known if malignancy itself impacts ovarian reserve. As more breast cancer patients consider future fertility, it is important to determine if ovarian reserve is impacted by cancer, prior to any therapeutic intervention. A cross-sectional study was conducted comparing if ovarian reserve, as measured by anti-mullerian hormone (AMH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and inhibin B (inhB), differed between 108 women with newly diagnosed breast cancer and 99 healthy women without breast cancer. Breast cancer participants were ages 28-44 and were recruited from two clinical breast programs. Healthy women ages 30-44 without a history of infertility were recruited from gynecology clinics and the community. The median age (interquartile range) was 40.2(5.5) years for breast cancer participants and 33.0(4.6) years for healthy controls. The unadjusted geometric mean AMH levels (SD) for breast cancer participants and controls were 0.66(3.6) and 1.1(2.9) ng/mL, respectively. Adjusting for age, body mass index, gravidity, race, menstrual pattern, and smoking, mean AMH levels were not significantly different between breast cancer participants and healthy controls (0.85 vs. 0.76 ng/mL, p = 0.60). FSH and inhB levels did not differ by breast cancer status. In exploratory analysis, the association between AMH and breast cancer status differed by age (p-interaction = 0.02). AMH may be lower with breast cancer status in women older than 37. In younger women, AMH levels did not differ significantly by breast cancer status. Among the youngest of breast cancer patients, ovarian reserve as measured by AMH, FSH, and inhibin B did not differ significantly from healthy women of similar age. In older breast cancer patients, ovarian reserve may be adversely impacted by cancer status. These findings support the potential success and need for fertility preservation strategies prior to institution of cancer treatment.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Transvaginal sonography is frequently used in the emergency department (ED) to triage pregnancies of unknown location. The purpose of this study was to examine the utility of sonography in clinically stable patients with β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) values below the discriminatory zone. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 408 consecutive ED patients who presented with pregnancies of unknown location and serum β-hCG levels between 5 and 2500 mIU/mL and underwent transvaginal sonography. Women were classified as receiving immediate treatment or expectant management. Predictors associated with immediate treatment were assessed by bivariate analyses and logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the cohort, 361 women (88.5%) received expectant management, and 6.9%, 3.1%, and 0% of patients with pregnancies of unknown location and β-hCG levels below 1000, 200, and 75 mIU/mL, respectively, received immediate treatment. Compared to the expectant management group, women receiving immediate treatment (n=47) were further from the last menstrual period (7.86 versus 6.10 weeks; P <.01), were more likely to report pain (59.6% versus 40.2% P = .01), had higher β-hCG levels(1183 versus 608 mIU/mL; P <.01), and had lower hematocrit levels (35.7% versus 37.0%; P < .01), with pain the most predictive factor for immediate treatment (odds ratio,5.97; 95% confidence interval, 2.45-14.53). A model combining symptoms, β-hCG, hematocrit, and weeks since the last menstrual period predicted the likelihood of sonography changing management from expectant management to immediate treatment with specificity of 98%. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic utility of sonography in clinically stable patients presenting to the ED in very early pregnancy is limited. A model using symptoms, β-hCG, hematocrit, and the last menstrual period may aid clinicians to triage those who would benefit from immediate sonography.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Associations between menstrual cycle length and chronic diseases are hypothesized to be due to differences in underlying hormonal patterns. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the association between menstrual cycle length and the hormonal profile and anovulation. DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a prospective cohort study at the University at Buffalo from 2005 to 2007. PARTICIPANTS: We recruited 259 healthy, regularly menstruating women aged 18-44 yr. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cycle length was observed for up to two cycles. Serum estradiol, progesterone, LH, and FSH were measured up to eight times per cycle for up to two cycles. RESULTS: Women with short cycles (<26 d) had higher FSH concentrations during menses and in the late luteal phase, higher follicular estradiol concentrations, and lower LH concentrations across the cycle. Among women with longer cycles (>35 d), estradiol and LH peaks occurred on average about 3 d later, and FSH peaks about 1 d later compared to women with normal-length cycles. Both short and long cycles, compared with normal-length cycles, had an increased probability of anovulation. In general, per-cycle exposure to hormones was less in short cycles based on the area under the curve, although over time the cumulative exposure to estradiol would be greater for women with short cycles. CONCLUSIONS: Short ovulatory cycles were associated with higher follicular phase estradiol, an earlier rise in FSH, and an increased risk of anovulation. These results suggest that menstrual cycle length may be a relevant indicator of estradiol exposure and risk of anovulation among regularly cycling women.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Over-the-counter vaginal lubricants have been shown to negatively affect in vitro sperm motility. The objective of this study was to estimate the effect of vaginal lubricant use during procreative intercourse on natural fertility. METHODS: Women aged 30-44 years with no history of infertility who had been trying to conceive for less than 3 months completed a baseline questionnaire on vaginal lubricant use. Subsequently, women kept a diary to record menstrual bleeding, intercourse, and vaginal lubricant use and conducted standardized pregnancy testing for up to 6 months. Diary data were used to determine the fertile window and delineate lubricant use during the fertile window. A proportional hazards model was used to estimate fecundability ratios with any lubricant use in the fertile window considered as a time-varying exposure. RESULTS: Of the 296 participants, 75 (25%) stated in their baseline questionnaire that they use vaginal lubricants while attempting to conceive. Based on daily diary data, 57% of women never used a lubricant, 29% occasionally used a lubricant, and 14% used a lubricant frequently. Women who used lubricants during the fertile window had similar fecundability to those women who did not use lubricants (fecundability ratio 1.05, 95% confidence interval 0.59-1.85) after adjusting for age, partner race, and intercourse frequency in the fertile window. CONCLUSION: Lubricants are commonly used by couples during procreative intercourse. Lubricant use during procreative intercourse does not appear to reduce the probability of conceiving.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Limitations in our current knowledge of normative physiologic changes in thyroid function during the periconception window narrow our ability to establish an optimal approach to screening and diagnosis of thyroid disease in pregnant women. The objective of this study was to characterize changes in thyroid function during the transition from the pre-pregnant to pregnant state in normal fertile women. METHODS: Women (N = 60) ages 30-42 years without a history of thyroid disease, who were planning pregnancy, were observed prospectively before and during early pregnancy. Thyroid function (thyroid stimulating hormone, TSH and free thyroxine, FT4) was measured before conception and between 6 and 9 weeks gestation. Pre-pregnancy samples were analyzed for thyroid antibodies. Bivariate analyses and longitudinal curves (general estimating equation models) were used to analyze changes in thyroid function during the periconception window by antibody status. RESULTS: Pre-pregnancy TSH values were significantly higher than early pregnancy TSH (p < 0.001), but FT4 values did not differ (p = 0.53). TSH declined as gestational age increased (P < 0.01). Thyroid antibody positive women had a higher pre-pregnancy TSH compared to antibody negative women (p < 0.01). Periconceptional change in thyroid function was more variable among women with antibodies (p < 0.001). 50% of women with elevated pre-pregnancy TSH values (TSH > 3.0 mIU/L) had normal TSH values (TSH < 2.5 mIU/L) in pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: TSH values decline during the transition from pre-pregnancy to early pregnancy. The change in TSH appears to be less predictable in women with thyroid antibodies. Periconceptional changes in thyroid function should be considered in formulating prenatal thyroid screening guidelines.",

        "abstract": "The objective of the present commentary is to suggest that epidemiologists explore the use of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) as a new measurement tool in fecundability studies. The authors briefly summarize the advantages and limitations of the 3 current approaches to studies of fecundability. All 3 approaches involve the collection of time-to-pregnancy or attempt-time data, and most are limited to participants who plan their pregnancies. AMH is produced by ovarian follicles during their early growth stages and is measured clinically to assess ovarian reserve (the number of remaining oocytes). Unlike time to pregnancy, serum AMH level can be assessed regardless of pregnancy-attempt status. Measurements are not significantly affected by phase of the menstrual cycle, oral contraceptive use, or early pregnancy. The authors suggest that AMH measurement can be a valuable addition to traditionally designed fecundability studies. In addition, this hormone should be investigated as an independent measure of fecundability in studies that focus on exposures hypothesized to target the ovary.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The higher prevalence of preterm birth (PTB) and low birthweight (LBW) following infertility treatment may relate to the treatment itself or indicate that subfertility predisposes to a higher risk. Our aim was to examine whether basal FSH levels are related to the risk for PTB and LBW among pregnancies resulting from IVF. METHODS: We studied a retrospective cohort in the 2008 National Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology Database, including all women who underwent a fresh non-donor IVF cycle resulting in a singleton live birth having a recorded basal serum FSH value (n = 14 262). The FSH value used was either the maximum basal or clomiphene-stimulated serum level. Log binomial models were created to assess the associations between FSH and PTB (<37 weeks), and between FSH and LBW (<2500 g), adjusting for maternal age, ethnicity, gravidity/parity, history of PTB, smoking, BMI and infant gender. RESULTS: Data for 14 086 patients were analyzed. FSH levels were inversely related to the risk of PTB and LBW. Women in the highest quartile of FSH levels (≥ 9 mIU/ml) had the longest adjusted mean gestational age (271.2 days), the lowest adjusted relative risk (RR) of PTB [0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.76-1.01], the highest adjusted mean birthweight (3249 g) and the lowest adjusted RR of LBW (0.89, 95% CI: 0.73-1.04). CONCLUSIONS: The inverse relationship between maximal basal FSH levels and the risk for PTB and LBW in singleton IVF gestations suggests that diminished ovarian reserve is not the primary mediator of the increased prevalence of PTB and LBW in IVF pregnancies.",

        "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare short-term and pregnancy-related outcomes of laparoscopy with laparotomy for management of a persistent second-trimester adnexal mass. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of pregnant women at 14 weeks or more of gestation undergoing laparoscopy or laparotomy for management of an adnexal mass (Canadian Task Force classification II-2). SETTING: University hospital. PATIENTS: Women of reproductive age with a persistent adnexal mass at 14 weeks or more of gestation. INTERVENTION: Removal of adnexal mass via laparoscopy or laparotomy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Between 1990 and 2008, 101 pregnant women underwent treatment of a persistent adnexal mass at 14 weeks or more of gestation at our institution. Fifty women underwent laparoscopy, and 51 underwent laparotomy. Similar demographic and adnexal mass characteristics were identified between the 2 surgical groups. Eight patients in the laparotomy group experienced postoperative complications, compared with none in the laparoscopy group (p < .02). Mean surgical estimated blood loss and length of hospital stay were significantly less in the laparoscopy group compared with the laparotomy group: 17.5 mL vs 100 mL (p < .001) and 0.7 days vs 2.78 days (p < .001), respectively. There were no observed differences in pregnancy-related outcomes between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Minimally invasive surgery is a reasonable approach to management of a second-trimester adnexal mass in gravid women. Laparoscopy enables a shorter hospital stay, decreased blood loss, and fewer postoperative complications without seeming to have a negative effect on pregnancy-related outcomes. While these findings are reassuring, larger studies are encouraged to continue to evaluate this issue.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To generate estimates of the association between markers of ovarian aging and natural fertility in a community sample at risk for ovarian aging. METHODS: Women aged 30-44 years with no history of infertility who had been trying to conceive for less than 3 months provided early-follicular phase serum and urine (N=100). Subsequently, these women kept a diary to record menstrual bleeding and intercourse and conducted standardized pregnancy testing for up to 6 months. Serum was analyzed for estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), antimüllerian hormone, and inhibin B. Urine was analyzed for FSH and estrone 3-glucuronide. Diary data on menstrual cycle day and patterns of intercourse were used to calculate day-specific fecundability ratios. RESULTS: Sixty-three percent of participants conceived within 6 months. After adjusting for age, 18 women (18%) with serum antimüllerian hormone levels of 0.7 ng/mL or less had significantly reduced fecundability given intercourse on a fertile day compared with women with higher antimüllerian hormone levels (fecundability ratio 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.08-0.91). The day-specific fecundability for women with early-follicular phase serum FSH values greater than 10 milli-international units/mL compared with women with lower FSH levels was also reduced, although nonsignificantly (11% of women affected; fecundability ratio 0.44; 95% CI 0.08-1.10). The association with urinary FSH was weaker (27% women affected; fecundability ratio 0.61; 95% CI 0.26-1.26), and the associations for the other markers were weaker still. CONCLUSION: Early-follicular phase antimüllerian hormone appears to be associated with natural fertility in the general population. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To estimate the extent to which duration and quality of reproductive endocrinology rotations are associated with residents' knowledge of reproductive endocrinology and infertility. METHODS: An anonymous, multiple-choice survey was provided to 4,744 examinees during the 2008 Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology In-Training Examination. The survey queried residents' experiences on their reproductive endocrinology and infertility rotation, satisfaction with the quality and duration of the rotation, and knowledge of reproductive endocrinology and infertility. Binomial regression was used to estimate the relationship between components of the reproductive endocrinology and infertility rotation and self-reported knowledge of reproductive endocrinology and infertility. RESULTS: Forty percent of residents described their knowledge of reproductive endocrinology and infertility as poor. Fewer weeks dedicated to reproductive endocrinology and infertility increased the risk of poor knowledge (P<.001). Required vacation during the rotation and non-reproductive endocrinology and infertility coverage more than two times a week was associated with a 40% increase in risk of perceived poor knowledge (relative risk [RR] 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]): 1.20-1.60; and RR 1.40, 95% CI: 1.16-1.70, respectively), while 3 hours of didactics per week were associated with a 61% reduction in risk (RR 0.39, 95% CI: 0.31-0.50). CONCLUSION: A number of residents perceive their knowledge of reproductive endocrinology and infertility to be poor. Conflicting commitments during the reproductive endocrinology rotation results in both lower satisfaction and less knowledge. There is the potential to improve resident knowledge of reproductive endocrinology and infertility, and perhaps other aspects of obstetrics and gynecology training, with focused rotations, including didactics.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUNDSporadic anovulation among regularly menstruating women is not well understood. It is hypothesized that cholesterol abnormalities may lead to hormone imbalances and incident anovulation. The objective was to evaluate the association between lipoprotein cholesterol levels and endocrine and metabolic disturbances and incident anovulation among ovulatory and anovulatory women reporting regular menstruation.METHODSThe BioCycle Study was a prospective cohort study conducted at the University at Buffalo from September 2005 to 2007, which followed 259 self-reported regularly menstruating women aged 1844 years, for one or two complete menstrual cycles. Sporadic anovulation was assessed across two menstrual cycles.RESULTSMean total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides levels across the menstrual cycles were higher during anovulatory cycles (mean difference: 4.6 (P= 0.01), 3.0 (P= 0.06) and 6.4 (P =0.0002) mg/dl, respectively, adjusted for age and BMI). When multiple total cholesterol (TC) measures prior to expected ovulation were considered, we observed a slight increased risk of anovulation associated with increased levels of TC (odds ratio per 5 mg/dl increase, 1.07; 95 confidence interval, 0.99, 1.16). Sporadic anovulation was associated with an increased LH:FSH ratio (P =0.002), current acne (P =0.02) and decreased sex hormone-binding globulin levels (P= 0.005).CONCLUSIONSThese results do not support a strong association between lipoprotein cholesterol levels and sporadic anovulation. However, sporadic anovulation among regularly menstruating women is associated with endocrine disturbances which are typically observed in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. © 2010 The Author.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Residency training programs seek to train future clinicians but also to stimulate scholarly interests and develop future academic physicians. PURPOSE: The goal was to determine if participation in an annual departmental research day is associated with future academic productivity among pediatrics trainees. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study enrolled all residents and fellows at our institution between 1985 and 2007. In 1985, our department began an annual Evening of Scholarship (EOS) at which both residents and fellows could voluntarily present submitted research and other scholarly work. We compared future academic productivity, measured by the number of future publications, between EOS participants and nonparticipants after controlling for confounding variables. RESULTS: There were 526 unique participants included (residents n=304 and fellows n=222). Participants in EOS (n=232) were more likely than nonparticipants to be male (53% vs. 30%, respectively, p<.001), be a fellow (63% vs. 27%, p<.001), and have published previously (31% vs. 15%, p<.001). Participants in EOS were more likely than nonparticipants to have publications after graduation (69% vs. 34%, p<.001), and this persisted in multivariate analysis (odds ratio [OR] for future publication in participants compared to nonparticipants equals 3.7, 95% CI=2.5-5.6) In addition, participants had significantly more publications after training (Mdn=2, interquartile range [IQR] 0-9.75, vs. 0, IQR 0-1, p<.001). The association was stronger for resident trainees (test of interaction, p=.01, ORresidents=4.7, 95% CI=2.7-8.3, ORfellows=1.6, 95% CI=0.82-3.0). CONCLUSIONS: An annual research day was significantly and strongly associated with future publications among resident trainees.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Exogenous estrogens have been shown to affect the lipid profile, leading to the hypothesis that endogenous estrogens may have similar effects. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the association between endogenous estrogen and serum lipoproteins across the menstrual cycle. DESIGN: This was a prospective cohort study. SETTING: The study was conducted at the University at Buffalo, 2005-2007. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 259 healthy, regularly menstruating women aged 18-44 yr. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum levels of total, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides measured up to eight times per cycle for up to two cycles were measured. RESULTS: Total and LDL cholesterol were lower during the luteal phase as compared with the follicular phase (P < 0.001), and HDL levels were highest around ovulation (P < 0.001). More women were classified above the desirable range (LDL > or =130 mg/dl or total cholesterol > or =200 mg/dl) when measured during the follicular phase. Estradiol was positively associated with HDL in acute effects models [beta = 0.019, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.015, 0.022] and inversely associated with total (beta = -0.017, 95% CI -0.020, -0.014) and LDL cholesterol (beta = -0.023, 95% CI -0.027, -0.018) and triglycerides (beta = -0.041, 95% CI -0.054, -0.029) in persistent effects models. CONCLUSIONS: Endogenous estrogen, like exogenous estrogen, appears to have beneficial effects on the lipid profile. Because lipoprotein cholesterol levels vary across the menstrual cycle, cyclic variations in lipoprotein levels may need to be considered in the design and interpretation of studies in reproductive-age women and in the clinical management of women's cholesterol.",

        "abstract": "Oocytes are formed in utero; menopause occurs when the oocyte pool is depleted. The authors hypothesized that early-life events could affect the number of a woman's oocytes and determine age at menopause. To test their hypothesis, the authors conducted a secondary analysis of baseline data from 22,165 participants in the Sister Study (2003-2007) who were aged 35-59 years at enrollment. To estimate the association between early-life events and age at natural menopause, the authors used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals, adjusting for current age, race/ethnicity, education, childhood family income, and smoking history. Earlier menopause was associated with in-utero diethylstilbestrol exposure (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.27, 1.65). Suggestive associations included maternal prepregnancy diabetes (HR = 1.33, 95% CI: 0.89, 1.98) and low birth weight (HR = 1.09, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.20). Having a mother aged 35 years or older at birth appeared to be associated with a later age at menopause (HR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.89, 1.01). Birth order, in-utero smoke exposure, and having been breastfed were not related to age at menopause. In-utero and perinatal events may subsequently influence age at menopause.",

METHODS: This case-control study included 213 women with singleton pregnancies who underwent both serum aneuploidy screening and invasive prenatal diagnosis. 18 patients carrying an aneuploid fetus served as cases and the remaining 195 women with a euploid fetus were controls. Serum AMH was measured using two assays: AMHbc (Beckman-Coulter) and AMHdsl (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories). Karyotypes were determined by chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. RESULTS: AMHbc levels did not differ between women with an aneuploid fetus and women with a euploid fetus (p = 0.46) and did not predict aneuploidy (ROC Area = 0.57). Additionally, AMHbc values declined significantly with advancing gestational age. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal AMH does not appear to be a marker of fetal aneuploidy in ongoing pregnancies. Contrary to previous reports, we found a significant decline in maternal AMH levels with advancing gestational age.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Smoking is associated with increased follicle-stimulating hormone levels and early menopause. Smoking may directly accelerate ovarian follicular depletion or may act indirectly by increasing the pituitary production of follicle-stimulating hormone. Antimüllerian hormone (AMH), produced by ovarian follicles, is a more direct measure of ovarian reserve. The objective of our study was to determine the extent to which smoking influences ovarian reserve, as measured by AMH levels. METHODS: A community sample of 284 women aged 38 to 50 years completed a self-administered questionnaire including a detailed smoking history. Serum AMH levels were measured on day 2, 3, or 4 of the menstrual cycle. The association between AMH and smoking was analyzed using linear regression, adjusting for age and body mass index. RESULTS: Participants aged 38 to 42, 43 to 45, and 46 to 50 years had geometric mean AMH values of 6.7 pM (95% CI, 5.2-8.7 pM), 2.7 pM (95% CI, 1.9-3.8 pM), and 1.3 pM (95% CI, 1.0-1.7 pM), respectively. Current smokers, but not past smokers, had 44% lower AMH values than did the reference group (participants with neither active nor former or passive smoke exposure; P = 0.04). Passive smoking had no effect on AMH values when compared with the reference group (P = 0.55). The impact of smoking on AMH values was not dose dependent based on cigarettes per day (P = 0.08) or pack-years (P = 0.22). Finally, prenatal exposure to smoking (either maternal or paternal) had no impact on AMH levels (P = 0.47 and P = 0.89, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Active smoking, but not former smoking, is associated with decreased AMH values in late-reproductive-age and perimenopausal women, suggesting a possible direct effect of smoking on the depletion of the antral but not primordial follicles. The direct impact of active smoking on AMH levels in younger women requires further investigation.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The study was conducted to examine the impact of oral contraceptives (OCs) on serum antimullerian hormone (AMH) levels by obesity status in reproductive-age women. STUDY DESIGN: Ovulatory women, ages 18-35 years, of normal (<25 kg/m(2); n=10) and obese (>30 kg/m(2); n=10) body mass index (BMI) received a low-dose OC (20 mcg ethinyl estradiol/100 mcg levonorgestrel) for two cycles. Serum samples obtained at several time points during active pill use and hormone-free intervals were analyzed for AMH, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol and inhibin B. RESULTS: AMH levels did not differ by OC cycle day in either BMI group. On average, AMH levels were 34% lower in the obese group (2.9+/-2.1 vs. 4.4+/-1.8 ng/mL, p<.05). Modeling to determine differences in AMH throughout the cycle based on obesity status demonstrated significantly lower levels (p<.05), whereas serum AMH, FSH, LH, estradiol and inhibin B levels revealed no correlations when all time points were included. CONCLUSIONS: In reproductive-age women, serum AMH levels do not appear to fluctuate during OC use, but AMH levels are significantly lower in obese women. Lower levels do not appear to be due to differences in gonadotropin levels or ovarian activity.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe the distribution of E2 change after antagonist treatment and evaluate the prognostic implications on cycle outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed all antagonist IVF cycles from 2002 to 2007 in a university clinic, if E2 levels preantagonist and postantagonist administration were available (N = 287). Distributions of E2 response (defined as posttreatment/pretreatment E2 ratio) to antagonist treatment were composed and categorized by quartiles, and outcomes were analyzed (oocyte yield, clinical pregnancy and live birth rates). RESULTS: Cycles in the upper quartile had higher oocyte yield (15.2 +/- 7.5 vs. 13.1 +/- 7.9 vs. 11.8 +/- 5.6, upper, middle and lower quartiles, p<0.01), clinical pregnancy (45.9% vs. 28.7% vs. 25.0%, p=0.01) and live birth rates (38.6% vs. 22.3% vs. 20.0%, p=0.02) than cycles in middle and lower quartiles. However, cycles in the lowest quartile did not have significantly different outcomes from the majority of cycles in the cohort (middle quartiles of E2 distribution). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that E2 rise after antagonist initiation is positively associated with higher oocyte yield and clinical pregnancy.

These markers seem to be affected by common ovarian toxicants, such as smoking, which advance the age at menopause. Although available for commercial use, home test kits have not been shown to predict fertility or infertility in the general population. Clinical use of these markers is limited by the variety of assays, lack of definitive thresholds, and their intercycle variability in older women. Results should be conveyed with caution when highly discrepant with age, in the obese, and in women with irregular menstrual cycles.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Early follicular phase follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), a marker of ovarian reserve, has been used to predict time to menopause. A mother's age at menopause is related to her daughter's age at menopause, possibly because of genetic factors. In this study we sought to determine the relationship between maternal age at menopause and early follicular phase FSH of premenopausal daughters. DESIGN: The Uterine Fibroid Study enrolled women randomly selected from a prepaid health plan, collected questionnaire data, and obtained early follicular phase urine samples for a subset of participants. For this secondary analysis, premenopausal women between the ages of 35 and 46 years, who provided a urine sample on cycle day 2, 3, 4, or 5 and their mother's age at natural menopause (n = 182) were selected from the original cohort. Initially bivariate analysis and subsequently regression modeling were performed to assess the independent relationship between maternal age at menopause and urinary creatinine-corrected FSH. RESULTS: Unadjusted analyses and those adjusting for age (mean +/- SD, 40.5 +/- 3.2 y), smoking status (16% current smokers), and body mass index (26.8 +/- 6.9 kg/m) showed a significant association between maternal age at menopause and daughter's urinary FSH level (P < 0.04). Women whose mothers experienced earlier menopause had higher urinary FSH levels. CONCLUSIONS: The significantly increased FSH values among women whose mothers experienced early menopause is consistent with previously reported associations between mother's and daughter's age of menopause. FSH, a marker of ovarian reserve, is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Future epidemiologic studies on FSH should include collection of information on maternal age at menopause.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the primary active androgen in peripheral target tissues, is metabolized by 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type III (3alpha-HSD), encoded by the AKR1C2 gene, forming 5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol (3alpha-diol). 3alpha-HSD may play a role in the pathogenesis of hirsutism. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to evaluate the role of 3alpha-HSD in hirsutism by comparing 1) tissue levels of active androgens, 2) relative gene expression of AKR1C2, and 3) activity of 3alpha-HSD in genital skin from normal and hirsute women. DESIGN: Genital skin was obtained from normal and hirsute women. After homogenization, testosterone (T) and DHT levels were quantified by conventional RIA. From isolated RNA, relative expression of AKR1C2 was determined by real-time PCR. In addition, minced genital skin was incubated with [(3)H]DHT, and the product, [(3)H]3alpha-diol, was quantified by radio-HPLC. SETTING: The study took place at an inner-city hospital. PATIENTS: PATIENTS included women undergoing posterior colporrhaphy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We assessed 1) tissue levels of T, DHT, and 3alpha-diol; 2) relative expression of AKR1C2; and 3) conversion ratio of [(3)H]3alpha-diol to [(3)H]DHT. RESULTS: In genital skin, tissue DHT and T concentrations in hirsute women were 1.90-fold and 1.84-fold higher than in normal women (P =0 .002 and 0.03), and relative expression of AKR1C2 mRNA was reduced approximately 7-fold (P = 0.04). Genital skin from hirsute women showed less metabolism of [(3)H]DHT to [(3)H]3alpha-diol (conversion ratio, 0.24 +/- 0.19 vs. 0.85 +/- 0.55, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In genital skin of hirsute women, reduced AKR1C2 gene expression and 3alpha-HSD activity results in decreased DHT metabolism and elevated tissue levels of DHT. Diminished DHT metabolism may play an important role in the pathogenesis of hirsutism.",

PATIENT(S): Women who conceived and delivered after age 50 (n = 49) following egg donation were matched to women in their 40s (n = 49) and women in their 30s (n = 49) who conceived via assisted reproduction with a similar date of embryo transfer and gestational order. INTERVENTION(S): Questionnaires addressing parenting stress (Parenting Stress Index, short form) and physical and mental functioning (Version 2 of the SF-36 Health Survey). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Norm-based scores for physical functioning, mental functioning, and total parenting stress (TS). RESULT(S): Women in their 50s showed a nonsignificant trend toward lower physical functioning scores compared with women in their 30s (54.8 +/- 4.1 vs. 56.9 +/- 4.3; P=.12) but higher mental functioning scores (53.6 +/- 7.3 vs. 50.1 +/- 7.0; P=.14). The percentage of subjects with high parenting stress (TS >80th percentile) varied between the groups but was not highest in the oldest (0%, 22%, and 6%, in the 30s, 40s, and 50s groups, respectively; P=.03). Adjustments for potential confounders did not alter the findings. CONCLUSION(S): Our data do not support the hypothesis that mothers of advanced maternal age have reduced parenting capacity due to physical or mental ability or parenting stress.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To estimate the rates of endometrial hyperplasia, bleeding episodes, and interventions among menopausal women receiving unopposed oral estradiol or placebo therapy with ultrasound monitoring over 3 years. METHODS: Two-hundred eighteen healthy women with intact uteri enrolled in the Estrogen in the Prevention of Atherosclerosis Trial (EPAT) or the Women's Estrogen-Progestin Lipid-Lowering Hormone Atherosclerosis Regression Trial (WELL-HART) were randomly assigned to either 1 mg of micronized 17beta-estradiol (n=96) or placebo (n=122) daily for up to 3 years in a double-blind fashion. Patients were followed with annual measurement of endometrial thickness using transvaginal ultrasonography. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of uterine bleeding and endometrial biopsy. RESULTS: Over the study periods, nine women (9.4% of patients, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.6-15.2%) in the estradiol group developed hyperplasia. Eight of the nine cases (88.9%) of hyperplasia were simple without atypia. Women receiving estradiol were more likely than those receiving placebo to have at least one episode of uterine bleeding (67% versus 11% at 3 years, respectively, P<.001). Women in the estradiol group were also more likely to have an endometrial biopsy (48% versus 4% at 3 years, P<.001). Among women on estradiol, obesity (body mass index [BMI] greater than 30 kg/m(2)) significantly increased the odds of uterine bleeding compared with normal-weight patients (BMI 25 or less) (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.2-11.8). CONCLUSION: Short-term, unopposed estradiol therapy with gynecologic monitoring may be an option for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. Menopausal women choosing estradiol therapy, especially if obese, should anticipate uterine bleeding and the possibility of an endometrial biopsy.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine if 17beta-estradiol increases blood pressure in postmenopausal women. DESIGN: A total of 222 healthy postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to either 1 mg micronized 17beta-estradiol daily or placebo for 2 years. Blood pressure measurements were obtained every other month and common carotid artery intima-media thickness measured every 6 months. Statistical analyses comparing longitudinal changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure between treatment groups used a mixed general linear model including interaction terms to evaluate variations by age or estradiol level. RESULTS: Both placebo and estradiol groups showed small declines in systolic and diastolic blood pressure during the trial among the normotensive subjects and subjects on antihypertensive medications. However, the decline did not differ significantly between the groups. Treatment effects on systolic blood pressure differed significantly by the age of the subject (interaction P value = 0.04) with younger women on estradiol showing on average a rise in systolic blood pressure, and older women a decline. The association between serum estradiol level and systolic blood pressure showed a similar modification with age (P = 0.03). Changes in systolic blood pressure in women on estradiol were positively correlated with intima-media thickness progression (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 17beta-estradiol did not influence changes in blood pressure in normotensive or hypertensive women. The effect of 17beta-estradiol treatment on systolic blood pressure may be influenced by a woman's age. Estradiol may increase systolic blood pressure in younger postmenopausal women, while having the opposite effect in older postmenopausal women.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Both selective estrogen receptor modulators, tamoxifen and clomiphene have been used for ovulation induction for patients with anovulatory infertility. This meta-analysis sought to compare the effectiveness of tamoxifen to clomiphene for the induction of ovulation and achievement of pregnancy. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, BIOSIS, PreMEDLINE, CINAHL, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, DDSR, ACP Journal Club, DARE and CCTR, along with reference lists and national experts. Inclusion criteria were prospective clinical trials, which compared tamoxifen and clomiphene for ovulation induction in infertile couples with isolated anovulatory infertility. Main outcome measures were ovulation rate and clinical pregnancy rate. Pooled odds ratios were obtained using random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: Four trials were included. After pooling all the trials, the use of tamoxifen or clomiphene citrate resulted in similar ovulation rates [odds ratio (OR) 0.755, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.513-1.111]. There was no benefit of tamoxifen over clomiphene citrate in achievement of pregnancy per cycle (OR 1.056, 95% CI 0.583-1.912) or per ovulatory cycle (OR 1.162, 95% CI 0.632-2.134). CONCLUSIONS: Clomiphene citrate and tamoxifen are equally effective in inducing ovulation. Although data regarding pregnancy rates and outcome are limited, there does not appear to be a significant benefit of one medication over the other.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To measure the effect of competition among fertility centers on pregnancy and high-order multiple (HOM) gestation rates after IVF. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Four hundred eight fertility clinics registered with the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology as providing IVF services in 2000. Competition was defined as number of clinics in a geographically defined area. Demand for services was based on the population of reproductive-aged women. PATIENT(S): Three hundred eighty-one fertility clinics reporting clinical outcomes. INTERVENTION(S): Pregnancy rates, HOM gestation rates, population of reproductive-aged women, and number of competing clinics were calculated for each clinic from Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology and census data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The clinic HOM gestation rate (percentage of pregnancies that were HOM) and age-adjusted pregnancy rate. RESULT(S): The number of clinics in an area of competition ranged from 1 to 22. The HOM gestation rate per clinic ranged from 0% to 50%. As demand increased, competition increased. As competition increased, the number of HOM pregnancies per clinic decreased. In areas of low competition (1 to 2 clinics) the clinic HOM gestation rate was 8.43%, in areas of intermediate competition (3-7 clinics) 8.39%, and in areas of high competition (8-22 clinics) 8.24%. In areas with intermediate demand, high levels of competition resulted in fewer HOM pregnancies than intermediate competition (relative risk 0.56, 95% confidence interval 0.36-0.89) or low levels of competition (RR 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.35-0.94). Age-adjusted pregnancy rates did not differ by level of competition. CONCLUSION(S): According to these data, the risk of HOM gestation decreases with increasing competition among clinics; however, pregnancy rates are unaffected.",

        "abstract": "To determine if there are therapeutic advantages to oil-soluble contrast medium compared with water-soluble medium during hysterosalpingography.A randomized, controlled trial including 56 infertile patients undergoing hysterosalpingography was performed. After a hysterosalpingogram with water-soluble contrast demonstrated tubal patency, 30 patients were randomized to receive oil-soluble contrast medium (oil group) and 26 patients received no additional contrast medium (control group). The outcome was pregnancy and timing of pregnancy in relation to hysterosalpingography. There were 18 (64%) pregnancies in the oil group and 14 (56%) pregnancies in the control group. Mean time to achieve pregnancy was shorter in the oil group: 3.8 months in the oil group compared with 6.1 months in the control group (P =.06) There was a clinically meaningful improvement in pregnancy rates between the oil group and the control group at 1 month postprocedure (relative risk [RR] 2.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6, 7.2). However, at 12 months postprocedure, the advantage was diminished. (RR 1.3, CI 0.8, 2.1)Eighteen months after hysterosalpingography, contrast does not appear to influence cumulative pregnancy rates; however, the addition of oil-soluble contrast medium to water-soluble contrast medium may have the potential to reduce the time to conception.",

    "overview": "<p>Dr. Steiner's research focuses on reproductive aging, antim&uuml;llerian hormone (AMH), and predictors of fertility and infertility.&nbsp; Her research collaborators include Donna Baird, PhD, MPH and Anne Marie Jukic, PhD in the Epidemiology Branch of NIEHS. She recently completed <a href=\"http://www.med.unc.edu/timetoconceive\">Time to Conceive</a>, a prospective, time-to-pregnancy cohort study, which enrolled over 750 women ages 30-44. The purpose of the NICHD-funded study was to determine if markers of ovarian reserve are predictors of reproductive potential.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Steiner also is the primary investigator for the Duke site of the <a href=\"http://medicine.yale.edu/ysph/c2s2/rmn/\">Reproductive Medicine Network</a>.&nbsp; The Network is funded by the NICHD to conduct clinical studies to investigate problems in reproductive medicine including female and male infertility. She is also the primary investigator for the NICHD Reproductive Medicine Network MOXI trial, which seeks to determine if treatment of infertile males with antioxidants improves male fertility.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Dr. Steiner has served an associate editor for <i>Fertility &amp; Sterility</i> and<i> Human Reproduction</i>.&nbsp; She was a Women&rsquo;s Reproductive Health Research Scholar and has received a number of awards including a Junior Faculty Award and the Jefferson Pilot Fellowship Award.</p>\r\n<p>Dr. Steiner received her MPH from the UNC School of Public Health in 2003. Her MD degree was awarded <i>magna cum laude</i> from Emory University School of Medicine in 1998. Dr. Steiner completed both her internship and residency in Obstetrics and Gynecology at UNC.&nbsp; Prior to her appointment at UNC, she was a Fellow in the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology &amp; Infertility at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.&nbsp;</p>",
