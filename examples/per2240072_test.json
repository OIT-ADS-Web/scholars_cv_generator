            "abstract":"Conventional analysis of neuroscience data involves computing average neural activity over a group of trials and/or a period of time. This approach may be particularly problematic when assessing the response patterns of neurons to more than one simultaneously presented stimulus. In such cases the brain must represent each individual component of the stimuli bundle, but trial-and-time-pooled averaging methods are fundamentally unequipped to address the means by which multiitem representation occurs. We introduce and investigate a novel statistical analysis framework that relates the firing pattern of a single cell, exposed to a stimuli bundle, to the ensemble of its firing patterns under each constituent stimulus. Existing statistical tools focus on what may be called “first order stochasticity” in trial-to-trial variation in the form of unstructured noise around a fixed firing rate curve associated with a given stimulus. Our analysis is based upon the theoretical premise that exposure to a stimuli bundle induces additional stochasticity in the cell’s response pattern in the form of a stochastically varying recombination of its single stimulus firing rate curves. We discuss challenges to statistical estimation of such “second order stochasticity” and address them with a novel dynamic admixture point process (DAPP) model. DAPP is a hierarchical point process model that decomposes second order stochasticity into a Gaussian stochastic process and a random vector of interpretable features and facil-itates borrowing of information on the latter across repeated trials through latent clustering. We illustrate the utility and accuracy of the DAPP analysis with synthetic data simulation studies. We present real-world evidence of second order stochastic variation with an analysis of monkey inferior colliculus recordings under auditory stimuli.",

            "abstract":"The environment is sampled by multiple senses, which are woven together to produce a unified perceptual state. However, optimally unifying such signals requires assigning particular signals to the same or different underlying objects or events. Many prior studies (especially in animals) have assumed fusion of cross-modal information, whereas recent work in humans has begun to probe the appropriateness of this assumption. Here we present results from a novel behavioral task in which both monkeys (Macaca mulatta) and humans localized visual and auditory stimuli and reported their perceived sources through saccadic eye movements. When the locations of visual and auditory stimuli were widely separated, subjects made two saccades, while when the two stimuli were presented at the same location they made only a single saccade. Intermediate levels of separation produced mixed response patterns: a single saccade to an intermediate position on some trials or separate saccades to both locations on others. The distribution of responses was well described by a hierarchical causal inference model that accurately predicted both the explicit \"same vs. different\" source judgments as well as biases in localization of the source(s) under each of these conditions. The results from this task are broadly consistent with prior work in humans across a wide variety of analogous tasks, extending the study of multisensory causal inference to nonhuman primates and to a natural behavioral task with both a categorical assay of the number of perceived sources and a continuous report of the perceived position of the stimuli.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We developed a novel behavioral paradigm for the study of multisensory causal inference in both humans and monkeys and found that both species make causal judgments in the same Bayes-optimal fashion. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of behavioral causal inference in animals, and this cross-species comparison lays the groundwork for future experiments using neuronal recording techniques that are impractical or impossible in human subjects.",

            "abstract":"We accurately perceive the visual scene despite moving our eyes ~3 times per second, an ability that requires incorporation of eye position and retinal information. In this study, we assessed how this neural computation unfolds across three interconnected structures: frontal eye fields (FEF), intraparietal cortex (LIP/MIP), and the superior colliculus (SC). Single-unit activity was assessed in head-restrained monkeys performing visually guided saccades from different initial fixations. As previously shown, the receptive fields of most LIP/MIP neurons shifted to novel positions on the retina for each eye position, and these locations were not clearly related to each other in either eye- or head-centered coordinates (defined as hybrid coordinates). In contrast, the receptive fields of most SC neurons were stable in eye-centered coordinates. In FEF, visual signals were intermediate between those patterns: around 60% were eye-centered, whereas the remainder showed changes in receptive field location, boundaries, or responsiveness that rendered the response patterns hybrid or occasionally head-centered. These results suggest that FEF may act as a transitional step in an evolution of coordinates between LIP/MIP and SC. The persistence across cortical areas of mixed representations that do not provide unequivocal location labels in a consistent reference frame has implications for how these representations must be read out. NEW & NOTEWORTHY How we perceive the world as stable using mobile retinas is poorly understood. We compared the stability of visual receptive fields across different fixation positions in three visuomotor regions. Irregular changes in receptive field position were ubiquitous in intraparietal cortex, evident but less common in the frontal eye fields, and negligible in the superior colliculus (SC), where receptive fields shifted reliably across fixations. Only the SC provides a stable labeled-line code for stimuli across saccades.",

            "abstract":"Interactions between sensory pathways such as the visual and auditory systems are known to occur in the brain, but where they first occur is uncertain. Here, we show a multimodal interaction evident at the eardrum. Ear canal microphone measurements in humans (<i>n</i> = 19 ears in 16 subjects) and monkeys (<i>n</i> = 5 ears in three subjects) performing a saccadic eye movement task to visual targets indicated that the eardrum moves in conjunction with the eye movement. The eardrum motion was oscillatory and began as early as 10 ms before saccade onset in humans or with saccade onset in monkeys. These eardrum movements, which we dub eye movement-related eardrum oscillations (EMREOs), occurred in the absence of a sound stimulus. The amplitude and phase of the EMREOs depended on the direction and horizontal amplitude of the saccade. They lasted throughout the saccade and well into subsequent periods of steady fixation. We discuss the possibility that the mechanisms underlying EMREOs create eye movement-related binaural cues that may aid the brain in evaluating the relationship between visual and auditory stimulus locations as the eyes move.",

            "abstract":"Saccadic eye movements can be elicited by more than one type of sensory stimulus. This implies substantial transformations of signals originating in different sense organs as they reach a common motor output pathway. In this study, we compared the prevalence and magnitude of auditory- and visually evoked activity in a structure implicated in oculomotor processing, the primate frontal eye fields (FEF). We recorded from 324 single neurons while 2 monkeys performed delayed saccades to visual or auditory targets. We found that 64% of FEF neurons were active on presentation of auditory targets and 87% were active during auditory-guided saccades, compared with 75 and 84% for visual targets and saccades. As saccade onset approached, the average level of population activity in the FEF became indistinguishable on visual and auditory trials. FEF activity was better correlated with the movement vector than with the target location for both modalities. In summary, the large proportion of auditory-responsive neurons in the FEF, the similarity between visual and auditory activity levels at the time of the saccade, and the strong correlation between the activity and the saccade vector suggest that auditory signals undergo tailoring to match roughly the strength of visual signals present in the FEF, facilitating accessing of a common motor output pathway.",

            "abstract":"UNLABELLED: Understanding the relationship between the auditory selectivity of neurons and their contribution to perception is critical to the design of effective auditory brain prosthetics. These prosthetics seek to mimic natural activity patterns to achieve desired perceptual outcomes. We measured the contribution of inferior colliculus (IC) sites to perception using combined recording and electrical stimulation. Monkeys performed a frequency-based discrimination task, reporting whether a probe sound was higher or lower in frequency than a reference sound. Stimulation pulses were paired with the probe sound on 50% of trials (0.5-80 μA, 100-300 Hz, n = 172 IC locations in 3 rhesus monkeys). Electrical stimulation tended to bias the animals' judgments in a fashion that was coarsely but significantly correlated with the best frequency of the stimulation site compared with the reference frequency used in the task. Although there was considerable variability in the effects of stimulation (including impairments in performance and shifts in performance away from the direction predicted based on the site's response properties), the results indicate that stimulation of the IC can evoke percepts correlated with the frequency-tuning properties of the IC. Consistent with the implications of recent human studies, the main avenue for improvement for the auditory midbrain implant suggested by our findings is to increase the number and spatial extent of electrodes, to increase the size of the region that can be electrically activated, and to provide a greater range of evoked percepts. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Patients with hearing loss stemming from causes that interrupt the auditory pathway after the cochlea need a brain prosthetic to restore hearing. Recently, prosthetic stimulation in the human inferior colliculus (IC) was evaluated in a clinical trial. Thus far, speech understanding was limited for the subjects and this limitation is thought to be partly due to challenges in harnessing the sound frequency representation in the IC. Here, we tested the effects of IC stimulation in monkeys trained to report the sound frequencies they heard. Our results indicate that the IC can be used to introduce a range of frequency percepts and suggest that placement of a greater number of electrode contacts may improve the effectiveness of such implants.",

            "abstract":"The nature of disturbance in body experience in anorexia nervosa (AN) remains poorly operationalized despite its prognostic significance. We examined the relationship of subjective reports of sensitivity to and behavioral avoidance of sensory experience (e.g., to touch, motion) to body image disturbance and temperament in adult women currently diagnosed with AN (n = 20), women with a prior history of AN who were weight restored (n = 15), and healthy controls with no eating disorder history (n = 24). Levels of sensitivity to sensation and attempts to avoid sensory experience were significantly higher in both clinical groups relative to healthy controls. Sensory sensitivity was associated with body image disturbance (r(56) = .51, p < .0001), indicating that body image disturbance increased with increased global sensitivity to sensation. Sensory sensitivity was also negatively and significantly correlated with lowest BMI (r(2) = -.32, p < .001), but not current BMI (r(2) = .03, p = .18), and to the temperament feature of harm avoidance in both clinical groups. We discuss how intervention strategies that address sensitization and habituation to somatic experience via conditioning exercises may provide a new manner in which to address body image disturbance in AN.",

            "abstract":"Visual and auditory spatial signals initially arise in different reference frames. It has been postulated that auditory signals are translated from a head-centered to an eye-centered frame of reference compatible with the visual spatial maps, but, to date, only various forms of hybrid reference frames for sound have been identified. Here, we show that the auditory representation of space in the superior colliculus involves a hybrid reference frame immediately after the sound onset but evolves to become predominantly eye centered, and more similar to the visual representation, by the time of a saccade to that sound. Specifically, during the first 500 ms after the sound onset, auditory response patterns (N = 103) were usually neither head nor eye centered: 64% of neurons showed such a hybrid pattern, whereas 29% were more eye centered and 8% were more head centered. This differed from the pattern observed for visual targets (N = 156): 86% were eye centered, <1% were head centered, and only 13% exhibited a hybrid of both reference frames. For auditory-evoked activity observed within 20 ms of the saccade (N = 154), the proportion of eye-centered response patterns increased to 69%, whereas the hybrid and head-centered response patterns dropped to 30% and <1%, respectively. This pattern approached, although did not quite reach, that observed for saccade-related activity for visual targets: 89% were eye centered, 11% were hybrid, and <1% were head centered (N = 162). The plainly eye-centered visual response patterns and predominantly eye-centered auditory motor response patterns lie in marked contrast to our previous study of the intraparietal cortex, where both visual and auditory sensory and motor-related activity used a predominantly hybrid reference frame (Mullette-Gillman et al. 2005, 2009). Our present findings indicate that auditory signals are ultimately translated into a reference frame roughly similar to that used for vision, but suggest that such signals might emerge only in motor areas responsible for directing gaze to visual and auditory stimuli.",

In this study, we investigated whether eye position affects activity in both the central and shell regions. Accordingly, we mapped the location of eye position-sensitive neurons in six monkeys making spontaneous eye movements by sampling multiunit activity at regularly spaced intervals throughout the IC. We used a functional map based on auditory response patterns to estimate the anatomical location of recordings, in conjunction with structural MRI and histology. We found eye position-sensitive sites throughout the IC, including at 27% of sites in tonotopically organized recording penetrations (putatively the central nucleus). Recordings from surrounding tissue showed a larger proportion of sites indicating an influence of eye position (33-43%). When present, the magnitude of the change in activity due to eye position was often comparable to that seen for sound frequency. Our results indicate that the primary ascending auditory pathway is influenced by the position of the eyes. Because eye position is essential for visual-auditory integration, our findings suggest that computations underlying visual-auditory integration begin early in the ascending auditory pathway.",

Though normally thought of as a predominantly auditory structure, recent work has uncovered a variety of non-auditory influences on firing rate in the IC. Here, we map the location within the IC of neurons that respond to the onset of a fixation-guiding visual stimulus. Visual/visuomotor associated activity was found throughout the IC (overall, 84 of 199 sites tested or 42%), but with a far reduced prevalence and strength along recording penetrations passing through the tonotopically organized region of the IC, putatively the central nucleus (11 of 42 sites tested, or 26%). These results suggest that visual information has only a weak effect on early auditory processing in core regions, but more strongly targets the modulatory shell regions of the IC.",

            "abstract":"The inferior colliculus (IC) is a major processing center situated mid-way along both the ascending and descending auditory pathways of the brain stem. Although it is fundamentally an auditory area, the IC also receives anatomical input from non-auditory sources. Neurophysiological studies corroborate that non-auditory stimuli can modulate auditory processing in the IC and even elicit responses independent of coincident auditory stimulation. In this article, we review anatomical and physiological evidence for multisensory and other non-auditory processing in the IC. Specifically, the contributions of signals related to vision, eye movements and position, somatosensation, and behavioral context to neural activity in the IC will be described. These signals are potentially important for localizing sound sources, attending to salient stimuli, distinguishing environmental from self-generated sounds, and perceiving and generating communication sounds. They suggest that the IC should be thought of as a node in a highly interconnected sensory, motor, and cognitive network dedicated to synthesizing a higher-order auditory percept rather than simply reporting patterns of air pressure detected by the cochlea. We highlight some of the potential pitfalls that can arise from experimental manipulations that may disrupt the normal function of this network, such as the use of anesthesia or the severing of connections from cortical structures that project to the IC. Finally, we note that the presence of these signals in the IC has implications for our understanding not just of the IC but also of the multitude of other regions within and beyond the auditory system that are dependent on signals that pass through the IC. Whatever the IC \"hears\" would seem to be passed both \"upward\" to thalamus and thence to auditory cortex and beyond, as well as \"downward\" via centrifugal connections to earlier areas of the auditory pathway such as the cochlear nucleus.",

            "abstract":"The motor layers of the superior colliculus (SC) are thought to specify saccade amplitude and direction, independent of initial eye position. However, recent evidence suggests that eye position can modulate the level of activity of SC motor neurons. In this study, we tested whether initial eye position has an effect on microstimulation-evoked saccade amplitude. High (>300 Hz) and low (<300 Hz) frequency microstimulation was applied to 30 sites in the rostral part of the SC of two monkeys while they fixated one of six different locations. We found that the amplitude of the evoked saccades decreased with more contralateral initial eye positions. This effect was more pronounced in low frequency- compared to high frequency-evoked saccades, although it was present for both. Replication of these findings in head-free experiments showed that the effect of initial eye position was not due to physical constraints imposed by the oculomotor range. In addition to the effect of eye position on saccade amplitude, we also observed an increase in saccade latency and a decrease in the probability that microstimulation would evoke a saccade for low frequency stimulation at more contralateral eye positions. These findings suggest that an eye position signal can contribute to the read-out of the SC. Models of the saccadic pulse-step generator may need revision to incorporate an eye position modulation at the input stage.",

Orienting the eyes to look at sounds is essential to our ability to identify and understand the events occurring in our environment. This behavior involves both sensorimotor and multisensory integration: a sound elicits a movement of the visual sense organ, the eye, to bring the source of the sound under visual scrutiny. How are auditory signals converted into oculomotor commands? This chapter describes recent work concerning the necessary computational steps between sound and eye movement, and how they may be implemented in neural populations in the primate brain.",

            "abstract":"We use both vision and audition when localizing objects and events in our environment. However, these sensory systems receive spatial information in different coordinate systems: sounds are localized using inter-aural and spectral cues, yielding a head-centered representation of space, whereas the visual system uses an eye-centered representation of space, based on the site of activation on the retina. In addition, the visual system employs a place-coded, retinotopic map of space, whereas the auditory system's representational format is characterized by broad spatial tuning and a lack of topographical organization. A common view is that the brain needs to reconcile these differences in order to control behavior, such as orienting gaze to the location of a sound source. To accomplish this, it seems that either auditory spatial information must be transformed from a head-centered rate code to an eye-centered map to match the frame of reference used by the visual system, or vice versa. Here, we review a number of studies that have focused on the neural basis underlying such transformations in the primate auditory system. Although, these studies have found some evidence for such transformations, many differences in the way the auditory and visual system encode space exist throughout the auditory pathway. We will review these differences at the neural level, and will discuss them in relation to differences in the way auditory and visual information is used in guiding orienting movements.",

            "abstract":"The reference frame used by intraparietal cortex neurons to encode locations is controversial. Many previous studies have suggested eye-centered coding, whereas we have reported that visual and auditory signals employ a hybrid reference frame (i.e., a combination of head- and eye-centered information) (Mullette-Gillman et al. 2005). One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that sensory-related activity, which we studied previously, is hybrid, whereas motor-related activity might be eye centered. Here, we examined the reference frame of visual and auditory saccade-related activity in the lateral and medial banks of the intraparietal sulcus (areas lateral intraparietal area [LIP] and medial intraparietal area [MIP]) of 2 rhesus monkeys. We recorded from 275 single neurons as monkeys performed visual and auditory saccades from different initial eye positions. We found that both visual and auditory signals reflected a hybrid of head- and eye-centered coordinates during both target and perisaccadic task periods rather than shifting to an eye-centered format as the saccade approached. This account differs from numerous previous recording studies. We suggest that the geometry of the receptive field sampling in prior studies was biased in favor of an eye-centered reference frame. Consequently, the overall hybrid nature of the reference frame was overlooked because the non-eye-centered response patterns were not fully characterized.",

            "abstract":"Is sound location represented in the auditory cortex of humans and monkeys? Human neuroimaging experiments have had only mixed success at demonstrating sound location sensitivity in primary auditory cortex. This is in apparent conflict with studies in monkeys and other animals, in which single-unit recording studies have found stronger evidence for spatial sensitivity. Does this apparent discrepancy reflect a difference between humans and animals, or does it reflect differences in the sensitivity of the methods used for assessing the representation of sound location? The sensitivity of imaging methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging depends on the following two key aspects of the underlying neuronal population: (1) what kind of spatial sensitivity individual neurons exhibit and (2) whether neurons with similar response preferences are clustered within the brain. To address this question, we conducted a single-unit recording study in monkeys. We investigated the nature of spatial sensitivity in individual auditory cortical neurons to determine whether they have receptive fields (place code) or monotonic (rate code) sensitivity to sound azimuth. Second, we tested how strongly the population of neurons favors contralateral locations. We report here that the majority of neurons show predominantly monotonic azimuthal sensitivity, forming a rate code for sound azimuth, but that at the population level the degree of contralaterality is modest. This suggests that the weakness of the evidence for spatial sensitivity in human neuroimaging studies of auditory cortex may be attributable to limited lateralization at the population level, despite what may be considerable spatial sensitivity in individual neurons.",

            "abstract":"The inferior colliculus (IC) is normally thought of as a predominantly auditory structure because of its early position in the ascending auditory pathway just before the auditory thalamus. Here, we show that a majority of IC neurons (64% of 180 neurons) in awake monkeys carry visual- and/or saccade-related signals in addition to their auditory responses (P < 0.05). The response patterns involve primarily excitatory visual responses, but also increased activity time-locked to the saccade, slow rises in activity time-locked to the onset of the visual stimulus, and inhibitory responses. The presence of these visual-related signals suggests that the IC plays a role in integrating visual and auditory information. More broadly, our results show that interactions between sensory pathways can occur at very early points in sensory processing streams, which implies that multisensory integration may be a low-level rather than an exclusively high-level process.",

            "abstract":"Neural activity in the inferior colliculus (IC) likely plays an integral role in the processing of various auditory parameters, such as sound location and frequency. However, little is known about the extent to which IC neural activity may be influenced by the context in which sounds are presented. In this study, we examined neural activity of IC neurons in the rhesus monkey during an auditory task in which a sound served as a localization target for a saccade. Correct performance was rewarded, and the magnitude of the reward was varied in some experiments. Neural activity was also assessed during a task in which the monkey maintained fixation of a light while ignoring the sound, as well as when sounds were presented in the absence of any task. We report that neural activity increased late in the trial in the saccade task in 58% of neurons and that the level of activity throughout the trials could be modulated by reward magnitude for many neurons. The late-trial neural activity similarly increased in the fixation task in 39% of the neurons tested for this task but was not observed when sounds were presented in the absence of a behavioral task and reward. Together, these results suggest that a reward-related signal influences neural activity in the IC.",

            "abstract":"We studied the representation of eye-position information in the primate inferior colliculus (IC). Monkeys fixated visual stimuli at one of eight or nine locations along the horizontal meridian between -24 and 24 degrees while sounds were presented from loudspeakers at locations within that same range. Approximately 40% of our sample of 153 neurons showed statistically significant sensitivity to eye position during either the presentation of an auditory stimulus or in the absence of sound (Bonferroni corrected P < 0.05). The representation for eye position was predominantly monotonic and favored contralateral eye positions. Eye-position sensitivity was more prevalent among neurons without sound-location sensitivity: about half of neurons that were insensitive to sound location were sensitive to eye position, whereas only about one-quarter of sound-location-sensitive neurons were also sensitive to eye position. Our findings suggest that sound location and eye position are encoded using independent but overlapping rate codes at the level of the IC. The use of a common format has computational advantages for integrating these two signals. The differential distribution of eye-position sensitivity and sound-location sensitivity suggests that this process has begun by the level of the IC but is not yet complete at this stage. We discuss how these signals might fit into Groh and Sparks' vector subtraction model for coordinate transformations.",

            "abstract":"The integration of visual and auditory events is thought to require a joint representation of visual and auditory space in a common reference frame. We investigated the coding of visual and auditory space in the lateral and medial intraparietal areas (LIP, MIP) as a candidate for such a representation. We recorded the activity of 275 neurons in LIP and MIP of two monkeys while they performed saccades to a row of visual and auditory targets from three different eye positions. We found 45% of these neurons to be modulated by the locations of visual targets, 19% by auditory targets, and 9% by both visual and auditory targets. The reference frame for both visual and auditory receptive fields ranged along a continuum between eye- and head-centered reference frames with approximately 10% of auditory and 33% of visual neurons having receptive fields that were more consistent with an eye- than a head-centered frame of reference and 23 and 18% having receptive fields that were more consistent with a head- than an eye-centered frame of reference, leaving a large fraction of both visual and auditory response patterns inconsistent with both head- and eye-centered reference frames. The results were similar to the reference frame we have previously found for auditory stimuli in the inferior colliculus and core auditory cortex. The correspondence between the visual and auditory receptive fields of individual neurons was weak. Nevertheless, the visual and auditory responses were sufficiently well correlated that a simple one-layer network constructed to calculate target location from the activity of the neurons in our sample performed successfully for auditory targets even though the weights were fit based only on the visual responses. We interpret these results as suggesting that although the representations of space in areas LIP and MIP are not easily described within the conventional conceptual framework of reference frames, they nevertheless process visual and auditory spatial information in a similar fashion.",

However, auditory activity in the SC appears to be neither head- nor eye-centered but in a reference frame that is intermediate between both of these reference frames. This neurophysiological finding suggests that auditory saccades might not fully compensate for changes in initial eye position. Here, we investigated whether the accuracy of saccades to sounds is affected by initial eye position in rhesus monkeys. We found that, on average, a 12 degrees horizontal shift in initial eye position produced only a 0.6 to 1.6 degrees horizontal shift in the endpoints of auditory saccades made to targets at a range of locations along the horizontal meridian. This shift was similar in size to the modest influence of eye position on visual saccades. This virtually complete compensation for initial eye position implies that auditory activity in the SC is read out in a manner that is appropriate for generating accurate saccades to sounds.",

Few, if any, neurons had circumscribed receptive fields. Spatial sensitivity was broad: the proportion of the total sample of neurons responding to a sound at a given location ranged from 30% for ipsilateral locations to 80% for contralateral locations. These findings suggest that sound azimuth is represented via a population rate code of very broadly responsive neurons in primate inferior colliculi. This representation differs in format from the place code used for encoding the locations of visual and tactile stimuli and poses problems for the eventual convergence of auditory and visual or somatosensory signals. Accordingly, models for converting this representation into a place code are discussed.",

            "abstract":"BACKGROUND:Neurons in primary auditory cortex are known to be sensitive to the locations of sounds in space, but the reference frame for this spatial sensitivity has not been investigated. Conventional wisdom holds that the auditory and visual pathways employ different reference frames, with the auditory pathway using a head-centered reference frame and the visual pathway using an eye-centered reference frame. Reconciling these discrepant reference frames is therefore a critical component of multisensory integration. RESULTS:We tested the reference frame of neurons in the auditory cortex of primates trained to fixate visual stimuli at different orbital positions. We found that eye position altered the activity of about one third of the neurons in this region (35 of 113, or 31%). Eye position affected not only the responses to sounds (26 of 113, or 23%), but also the spontaneous activity (14 of 113, or 12%). Such effects were also evident when monkeys moved their eyes freely in the dark. Eye position and sound location interacted to produce a representation for auditory space that was neither head- nor eye-centered in reference frame. CONCLUSIONS:Taken together with emerging results in both visual and other auditory areas, these findings suggest that neurons whose responses reflect complex interactions between stimulus position and eye position set the stage for the eventual convergence of auditory and visual information.",

The visual, auditory, and cutaneous senses all contribute to the perception of stimulus location, but they acquire spatial information in radically different ways. Positional information is literally built into the neural wiring for vision and touch: stimuli at different positions in the environment activate receptors at different positions on the retina or on the body surface. In contrast, the topographic organization of the cochlea produces a map for the frequency content of a sound, not its direction. Sound source position must be inferred from the direction-dependent filtering of the sound by the external ear (spectral cues) and from differences in sound arrival time and pressure level (or intensity) across the two ears (binaural difference cues).",

The effect of eye position on auditory responses was substantial-comparable in magnitude to that of sound location.

            "abstract":"To track a moving object, its motion must first be distinguished from that of the background. The center-surround properties of neurons in the middle temporal visual area (MT) may be important for signaling the relative motion between object and background. To test this, we microstimulated within MT and measured the effects on monkeys' eye movements to moving targets. We found that stimulation at \"local motion\" sites, where receptive fields possessed antagonistic surrounds, shifted pursuit in the preferred direction of the neurons, whereas stimulation at \"wide-field motion\" sites shifted pursuit in the opposite, or null, direction. We propose that activating wide-field sites simulated background motion, thus inducing a target motion signal in the opposite direction. Our results support the hypothesis that neuronal center-surround mechanisms contribute to the behavioral segregation of objects from the background.",

            "abstract":"To generate behavioral responses based on sensory input, motor areas of the brain must interpret, or \"read out,\" signals from sensory maps. Our experiments tested several algorithms for how the motor systems for smooth pursuit and saccadic eye movements might extract a usable signal of target velocity from the distributed representation of velocity in the middle temporal visual area (MT or V5). Using microstimulation, we attempted to manipulate the velocity information within MT while monkeys tracked a moving visual stimulus. We examined the effects of the microstimulation on smooth pursuit and on the compensation for target velocity shown by saccadic eye movements. Microstimulation could alter both the speed and direction of the motion estimates of both types of eye movements and could also cause monkeys to generate pursuit even when the visual target was actually stationary. The pattern of alterations suggests that microstimulation can introduce an additional velocity signal into MT and that the pursuit and saccadic systems usually compute a vector average of the visually evoked and microstimulation-induced velocity signals (pursuit, 55 of 122 experiments; saccades, 70 of 122). Microstimulation effects in a few experiments were consistent with vector summation of these two signals (pursuit, 6 of 122; saccades, 2 of 122). In the remainder of the experiments, microstimulation caused either an apparent impairment in motion processing (pursuit, 47 of 122; saccades, 41 of 122) or had no effect (pursuit, 14 of 122; saccades, 9 of 122). Within individual experiments, the effects on pursuit and saccades were usually similar, but the occasional striking exception suggests that the two eye movement systems may perform motion computations somewhat independently.",

            "abstract":"Purpose. Tracking a moving target that appears in the periphery involves two kinds of eye movements, saccades and smooth pursuit. Both kinds of movements require a signal of target velocity. The saccadic system must use a target velocity signal to compensate for the motion of the target, and the pursuit system must use such a signal to match eye velocity to target velocity. We conducted a microstimulation experiment in two rhesus monkeys to compare the contribution of motion signals in MT to saccades and pursuit. Methods. We stimulated extrafoveal MT while monkeys performed a tracking task in which a target appeared in the multiunit receptive field of the site and moved either in the preferred direction of the site, the null direction, or not at all (saccade only trials). We stimulated (20-80 μamps, 200 Hz) from target onset until the monkey made a saccade to the target. We examined the effects of microstimulation on the endpoint of the saccade and on the average eye velocity over the first 60 ms of pursuit after the saccade. Results. Stimulation altered the velocity of pursuit in 71 out of 123 experiments, and altered the endpoints of saccades in 78 experiments. Both types of effects occurred in 50 experiments. The effects on saccades were quantified in terms of the velocity compensation, or the target velocity for which the saccade would be appropriate. For both pursuit and saccades, the effects of microstimulation were suggestive of vector averaging of the visual target and an electrically induced velocity signal. The nature of the effects on saccades and pursuit within a given experiment could be quite dissimilar, but across the whole population of experiments, the two types of effects were weakly correlated. Conclusions. The weak correlation between effects on pursuit and saccades suggests that the pathways from MT to the pursuit and saccade systems overlap to some extent, but the fact that the effects can occur independently and can be dissimilar to each other suggests a surprising degree of segregation of these pathways.",

            "abstract":"1. We compared the properties of saccades to somatosensory and visual targets. This comparison provides insight into the translation of sensory signals coding target location in different sensory coordinate frameworks into motor commands of a common format. Vibrotactile stimuli were delivered to the hands, which were fixed in position and concealed beneath a barrier. Saccades of different directions and amplitudes were elicited by the same somatosensory target from different initial eye positions. Both monkeys and humans served as subjects. 2. Somatosensory saccades were less accurate than visual saccades in both humans and monkeys. When the barrier concealing the hands was removed, somatosensory saccade accuracy improved. While the hands were concealed, the visual frame of reference provided by room illumination did not greatly affect saccade accuracy: accuracy was not degraded in complete darkness for two of three monkeys. 3. The endpoints of saccades to a single somatosensory target varied with initial eye position for the monkeys, but not for the human subjects. 4. We also found evidence of an effect of limb position on somatosensory saccades: when human subjects performed the task with crossed hands, the incidence of curved saccades increased. Saccades often began in the direction of the unstimulated hand and curved markedly toward the stimulated hand. When one subject was required to delay the saccade by 600-1,000 ms after target onset (the delayed saccade task), the saccades were straight. Somatosensory saccades were also straight when the hands were not crossed. 5. The reaction times of somatosensory saccades were longer than the reaction times of visual saccades, and they decreased as a function of saccade amplitude. The delayed saccade task reduced the differences between somatosensory and visual saccade reaction times. The reaction times of saccades to very dim visual targets increased into the range found for saccades to somatosensory targets. When the saccade target was the combination of the somatosensory and visual stimuli at the same location, the reaction time was slightly lower than for visual targets alone. 6. The peak velocities of somatosensory saccades were lower than those of visual saccades of the same amplitude. The velocities of saccades to combined somatosensory and visual targets were indistinguishable from those of saccades to visual targets alone. The differences between somatosensory and visual saccade velocity were maintained in the delayed trial type. These differences suggest that the main sequence or velocity-amplitude relationship characteristic of saccades depends on the modality of the target. 7. The implications of these modality-dependent differences in accuracy, reaction time, and saccade velocity are discussed with regard to models of the saccade generator and the coordinate transformation necessary for somatosensory saccades.",

            "abstract":"1. We examined cells with saccade-related activity in the superior colliculus (SC) of monkeys performing saccades to both somatosensory and visual targets. Our goals were 1) to determine whether signals from these separate sensory systems have converged onto a common motor pathway by the level of the SC; 2) to determine the frame of reference of somatosensory saccade signals in the SC; and 3) to relate collicular motor activity to the behavioral characteristics of somatosensory saccades. 2. Somatosensory targets consisted of vibrotactile stimuli delivered to the hands, which were held in fixed spatial positions. Saccades of different directions and amplitudes were elicited from different initial eye positions. Of 86 cells with motor-related activity, 85 (99%) discharged for saccades to both visual and somatosensory targets. The remaining cell was active only for visual saccades. 3. Cells with saccade-related activity had movement fields representing the direction and amplitude of saccades to both visual and somatosensory targets. We found no cells that discharged for saccades to a particular somatosensory target regardless of the vector of the saccade. 4. Small modality-dependent differences in the spatial tuning of the movement fields were observed, but these variations formed no clear pattern. Given the large population of cells active in conjunction with each saccade, these small tuning differences may have no net effect. Because the visual and somatosensory movement fields of individual cells were similar to each other, the inaccuracy of somatosensory saccades is likely to be the result of inaccurate signals reaching the SC, rather than an error signal added downstream. 5. The peak discharge frequency of collicular motor cells was lower for somatosensory saccades than for visual saccades, although the number of spikes in the discharge was about the same. 6. The latency of the onset of the prelude of motor activity following the cue to initiate a saccade was about the same for somatosensory and visual trials, even though somatosensory saccades have longer reaction times than visual saccades. However, the peak of the motor activity was delayed on somatosensory trials such that the timing of the peak was the same with respect to the movement on somatosensory and visual trials. 7. We conclude that the same population of saccade-related neurons in the SC that represents saccades to visual targets also represents saccades to somatosensory targets. Somatosensory saccades are encoded by these cells as the change in eye position necessary to bring the target onto the fovea, rather than the location of the stimulus on the body surface. Modality-dependent differences in the frequency and timing of collicular motor activity may contribute to velocity and reaction time differences.",

Our goal was to determine the frame of reference of collicular somatosensory signals by seeing whether the positions of the eyes influenced the responses of cells to a given tactile stimulus. Somatosensory targets consisted of vibrotactile stimuli delivered to the hands, which were held in fixed spatial positions. Monkeys performed a delayed saccade task from different initial fixation positions to the locations of these tactile stimuli or to visual stimuli at approximately the same location. 2. The responses of a majority of somatosensory cells (25 of 34 or 74%) were significantly affected by eye position. Nearly all somatosensory cells also responded to visual targets (28 of 30, 93%). Cells whose somatosensory responses depended on eye position responded to visual and somatosensory targets located at approximately the same direction in space with respect to the eyes. 3. The activity of these cells exhibited both sensory and motor qualities. The discharge was more closely linked in time to stimulus onset than to the movement. Sensory features of the stimulus were reflected in the responses: the discharge of a number of cells was phase-locked to the pulses of vibration. The sensory responses occurred even if the animal's next saccade was not directed into the response field of the cell. However, two thirds of the cells also exhibited a burst of motor activity in conjunction with the saccade to the somatosensory target. Sensory and motor activity were not always spatially coextensive. When different, the tuning of motor activity was broader. 4. Cells with somatosensory responses to vibratory stimulation of the hands were found in a wide region of the SC, spanning a 40 degrees range of movement amplitudes. 5. These data show that somatosensory signals in the SC are not purely somatotopic but are dependent on eye position. For stimuli at a fixed location, this eye position dependence allows somatosensory and visual signals to be in register and share a premotor circuitry for guiding saccadic eye movements. 6. The dependence of the somatosensory responses on eye position suggests that the somatosensory receptive fields may either shift on the body surface or they may be restricted to a limited region of the body surface but be gated by eye (and body) position. Future experiments varying body position and the location of the stimulus on the body surface are needed to determine which of these alternatives is correct. Cells with either type of receptive field could provide an unambiguous signal of the location of somatosensory saccade targets with respect to the eyes. The transformation of somatosensory signals from a body-centered frame of reference to a frame of reference that depends on the position of the stimulus with respect to the eyes is necessary for the correct activation of collicular neurons with motor activity, because this activity encodes saccades as desired changes in eye position.",

The vector subtraction model subtracts a rate-coded eye position signal from a topographically weighted auditory target position signal to produce a rate-code of target location with respect to the eye. The rate-code is converted into a place-code through a graded synaptic weighting scheme and inhibition. The dendrite model performs a mapping of head-centered auditory space onto the dendrites of eye-centered units. Individual dendrites serve as logical comparators of target location and eye position. Both models produce a topographic map of auditory space in eye-centered coordinates like that found in the primate superior colliculus. Either type can be converted into a model for transforming visual signals from retinal to head-centered coordinates.",

Sports-related concussions in children and adolescents (5-18 years) account for 30-60% of all pediatric concussions. Though mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is an important public health issue for both the general pediatric population and youth athletes, challenges exist in obtaining objective diagnoses of mTBI or quantifying the physiological implications of cumulative subconcussive (low-level) insults. Establishing a link between the clinical diagnoses and objective diagnostic tools that are sensitive over a spectrum of pathophysiology that includes the minimally sub-concussed child to those that experience many subconcussive events or are clinically diagnosed with a concussion are crucial in developing mitigation strategies.</p>",

      "overview":"Research in my laboratory concerns how sensory and motor systems work together, and how neural representations play a combined role in sensorimotor and cognitive processing (embodied cognition).  \n\nMost of our work concerns the interactions between vision and hearing.  We frequently perceive visual and auditory stimuli as being bound together if they seem likely to have arisen from a common source. That's why we tend not to notice that the speakers on TV sets or in movie theatres are located beside, and not behind, the screen. Research in my laboratory is devoted to investigating the question of how the brain coordinates the information arising from the ears and eyes. Our findings challenge the historical view of the brain's sensory processing as being automatic, autonomous, and immune from outside influence. We have recently established that neurons in the auditory pathway (inferior colliculus, auditory cortex) alter their responses to sound depending on where the eyes are pointing. This finding suggests that the different sensory pathways meddle in one another's supposedly private affairs, making their respective influences felt even at very early stages of processing. The process of bringing the signals from two different sensory pathways into a common frame of reference begins at a surprisingly early point along the primary sensory pathways.",
